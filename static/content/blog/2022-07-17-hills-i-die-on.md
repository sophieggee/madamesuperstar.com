## 10 Non-Negotiable Rules I Live By:


1. **Never** pay more than $20.00 for a tank top.
2. Under the circumstance that there is any type of moisturizer to apply afterwards, always wash your face before bed.
3. If the opportunity presents itself, jump in the body of water (hesitations and hair-wash-cycle-related-exceptions strictly prohibited).
4. With respect to courting: whoever asks, pays.
5. **Always** look the cashier in the eyes.
6. If any part of your body asks you to dance, in any setting, always say **yes**.
7. Leave a note of gratitude on the pillowcase of your host no matter how short the stay.
8. Listen to [Blondie's "Heart of Glass"](https://open.spotify.com/track/4v2rkl1mC3zVAz0nXMx9r4?si=b6463e508b3d45ee) anytime you are awake and driving before the sun has risen.
9. Go to the sale rack first.
10. Never deny yourself the pleasure of holding both hands of a loved one as you tell them what you feel.
