Today is my sister Anna’s 32nd birthday. In a recent journal entry, I compared my love for New York to the only feeling I could find that fit: the way I love my sister.

I was trying to express just how unbelievable I find New York City almost every day that I experience it. I really can’t imagine myself ever “getting over” living here. And I feel confident in that feeling because it’s the same experience as being Anna’s younger sister.

I will never know a world where she isn’t my sister, and I can tell you that I have not yet gotten over that fact.

When I was too young, I watched Lord of the Rings with my older cousins. All it took was one glance at Gollum to decide that sleeping alone in my “big girl bed” was no longer for me. My parents only lasted so long letting me sleep at the foot of their bed until I was sequestered to the hallway. Devastated, I turned to the only host in the house that I knew wouldn’t turn me away.

From the ages of 8-10, I slept on the decorative pillows of Anna’s bed laid out for me on the ground.

Being 16-18 herself, she had a slightly different schedule from her elementary-schooler roommate. Anna often had to stay up late to finish an assignment, or would be out later with her friends, but she never forgot to lay out my bed for me by bedtime.

Of course, I always appreciated these parts of Anna, even as a child. I was beside myself when she left for college, only to be consoled by a plane ticket to visit her scheduled for the following month. And I think if someone had watched my farewell through the window when she was leaving for her 18-month mission, they would safely assume I had just been given a terminal diagnosis. My wailing was borderline comical.

But it wasn’t until I reached my later high school years almost a decade later before I fully comprehended the selflessness that Anna has always possessed. I’m the youngest, so the only way I can relate to her position is through children of cousins or little siblings of close friends, but I think 16-year-old me would have been hard-pressed to allow her little sister unlimited sleepovers. Let alone with warm hospitality.

Not only did Anna let me sleep on her floor every night, but she also extended an indefinite invitation to be with her. That included playing “night games” with her friends in the park down the street, sitting with her girlfriends around her room listening to music, or driving in her car on the way to anywhere she was going.

If there was something happening at our house or that Anna had planned, I was invited. 

When I first visited Anna at school in Utah, she brought me into a crowd of people in her dorm lobby that were anxiously expecting me. Anna had told every one of her new friends all about me and they loved her so much already that they were excited to embrace this unfamiliar appendage with no questions asked.

That’s just how you become when you love Anna. She’s intentional and carries a certain humility about her. When she cares about something or someone enough to let herself tell you all about it/them, you start caring too.

My mom asked me the other day who my best friend was. For the first time in my life, I responded with “Anna”. I’ve never used that as my answer before, not because it hasn’t been true, but because I thought it would be a copout or something. She can’t be my best friend, I didn’t choose her, I just got really lucky.

But I realized as I was answering that if I am fortunate to have someone as purely good as Anna for a sister, I better take full advantage. 

I would say that if we weren’t sisters, I might not even be worthy enough to be her best friend. If she wasn’t forced to hang out with me, maybe she wouldn’t choose to. But that’s not how it is with her. 

She isn’t capable of making someone feel “unworthy” of her friendship. And if she’s only spending time with me out of obligation, she deserves an Oscar for her enthusiastic performance.

Anna makes every person on the other side of a conversation with her feel like the only person in the room. She’s an incredible listener with a heart that never seems to run out of space.

In her day-to-day, Anna works as a public defender for the people of Newark, NJ. She works tirelessly to research and compile cases for people left with no options. She sits with them in jails and prisons and treats them as a person who has hired her and deserves her best efforts. 

Sometimes, I get the distinct pleasure of listening to Anna on the phone with a client or a relative of one. She speaks gently and with such patience and empathy, that sometimes I find myself feeling jealous of the receiver. Until I remember that I have unlimited access to those listening ears and comforting words. 

Anna is great at her job, but it’s not a different hat she puts on to perform her duties as an attorney, her true and only self is constantly building a case for the people in her life, no matter their crime.

Sometimes I joke to her that when women complain to me about their relationships with their sisters, I have to pretend I’m in a play where I have an experience fighting with my sister, being annoyed at her for borrowing my clothes, wanting to be together but “not for too long because you know, it’s your sister not your friend”, etc. But in reality, I have never once felt annoyed by Anna. She’s never borrowed something of mine without asking, and we live a 15-minute walk from one another and I still ask to have sleepovers at least once a month.

One time I borrowed Anna’s silver jewelry box full of sentimental value and put something stupid like urban outfitters’ polaroids in it. I dumped out the contents of the box (any piece of jewelry that had ever meant something to her) somewhere and went along my merry way redecorating my room for the 7th time that school year.

Thankfully, we eventually found the jewelry, but for the entire year that passed after she remembered I had done that and before I could recall where it was, she never so much as let out a frustrated sigh at me. She was sad, and prepared to be disappointed had we not found the jewelry, but I can’t remember a time where she has outwardly expressed disappointment in me.

Anna works harder than anyone I know to understand where someone is coming from and why. She knows what matters to her and consistently behaves accordingly.

Being near her is one of my favorite pastimes, I doubt I will ever get used to how lucky I feel.

To the plea for relatability that is: “you know how sisters are”, I have to say, no I don’t. I only know how my sister is, and she’s the best person I know.
