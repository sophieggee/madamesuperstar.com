I am filling up the ice tray for my roommate (who lives in my heart as well) as I head out of town, and all of the sudden I am thinking of it as **"Doing What I Can for the Community"** (giving back in a small way (walking the talk)).

And then I remember about all the times my mom nagged us about refilling the **Nearly Empty Brita Filter Pitcher**. And I wonder if i’ve grown and somehow the act of me filling up this tray on my way out of town is some sort of symbol of that— 

or maybe does it mean something I'm scared of: that I’m better at serving my roommate than my parents. 

Here I will say that that pitcher met it’s demise by being thrown into the backyard in the night as a half-joke-half-statement made by my dad who was fed up with all the back and forth anyway.
