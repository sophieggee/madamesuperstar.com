My flight arrived at SEA-TAC at 8 am and I think I started crying sometime along the carpeted and rickety jet bridge walk into the painfully familiar north terminal. I started crying then and I didn’t stop until I fell asleep in my childhood bed. 

I started crying because I have made this solitary holiday trek for four years in a row now, and I won’t be making it again. I started crying because I think my heart is particularly sizable, and an even more defining characteristic of my heart is that it is actually as close to its surface as possible. And while these two facts about my heart make it a special place, they also make certain that the broken times do not go unnoticed. 

I think my heart looks like an underwater cave with glass trinkets sitting in every nook and cranny of its organic walls. And I think it is usually a light-filled haven with incredible acoustics and lots of comfortable sitting spaces. But when the big waves come it is hard to see anything other than the millions of broken pieces that are sweeping from wall to wall, and there is certainly no longer a place to sit. And the light that gets let in only illuminates all of the damage. 

It’s just that, we would be remiss to call it anything other than “Damage”.

I started crying because I hadn’t slept for very long before I woke up. And I get that way when my big heart gets woken up at a surprising time. I always have.

I started crying because I thought about the last time I was in this same state, I am sentimental that way. I started crying because the last time I was in this same state was so hard that I had to make a choice every morning that I woke up to actually just fight. 

And I kept crying because I thought about how the space between that home time and this home time was supposed to “heal” me, and fill me back up like a deflated balloon. I was supposed to come home for Christmas and all of the street signs and ducks in the local waters would recognize me because of course I don’t look that much different, but also notice that I’ve changed and grown since the summer. They would whisper about me after I was an appropriate distance away in passing them.

But I am home and it isn’t much like a reunion tour at all. 

It feels like I made it here on my dragging knees and with all of my insides in my arms falling out on either side like when you have too much mail to carry in from the car. I made it here just barely, by the skin of my teeth, or whatever they say. 

I know I must have just been strong or done something that I could be proud of because I’m still sore, and I remember it all hurting a lot. But I don’t have any medals or gold stars to prove it and when I look in the mirror, there isn’t even a smile there. 

When I got in the car at the arrivals curb my mom just brought my head under hers and held me for a while. She didn’t ask any questions or need to know “how was my flight”, she just started home rubbing my head with her arm outstretched across the middle console and found drive-through napkins to catch my tears. 

She rubbed my head in a sort of urgent way; each pass through, impatient to get back to the top and start the rhythmic soothing all over again.

Maybe the type of hard thing I just went through isn’t like medical school or a big race, and there’s no celebratory parade at the end (I’ve never been to medical school). But maybe the type of hard thing I just went through is supposed to end in silent tears. And maybe there are no more questions to ask. 

Instead, the hard thing is measured by how much left of you there is. And that’s not something that the drug store makes cellophane balloons for.
