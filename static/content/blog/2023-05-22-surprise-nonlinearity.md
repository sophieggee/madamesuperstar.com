I once wrote in my journal, “I believe that the space in which self-surprises happen is most often the best soil for growth”.

In the summer before my junior year of high school, I went to a new youth group camp with almost none of my friends and was placed into a leadership position. I was scared, and I had no concept for what the week might feel like, or any examples to look to for how I might act. For some reason, though, this independence and my lack of inhibitions gave me the space to surprise myself with my own gregariousness. I found myself feeling inexplicably close to the girls I was in charge of, and easily able to create a sense of comfort and trust with the adult leaders.

I still point to that week as the proudest I have ever made myself. I think a lot of that pride can be attributed to the fact that I exceeded my subconscious expectations. I allowed myself, whether I intended to or not, to differentiate my desires for connectedness from my hesitations towards “coming off too strong”, as they say. 

That week, surrounded by very few people that knew me in any other context, I was able to take on a role of my own creation. I was able to listen to certain calls within me that had always been there, but must have been buried under some Social Handbook during middle school, and never dusted off.

That summer was the first time I experienced the concept that I would later use to summarize the biggest lesson I learned in undergrad:

“What a blessing it is to have the independence and capacity to surprise yourself.”

The beautiful thing about this idea is that I can find it within the long, stabilizing breaths of the meditation that I turned to on nights that gave me no other option, as well as in the breaths I had to fight for between unceasing laughter on mornings that allowed for anything.

In the vast expanse of YouTube tutorials, high school courses, and mommy blogger books about the transition from youth to adulthood, you will find no shortage of discussion surrounding the everyday decisions that financial or otherwise independence might bring. You can learn how to raise your twin XL bed using cinderblocks, open up a credit card, or even how to politely decline a date.

What’s missing in this tome, however, is the how-to on when and where to breakup with someone you should still love, or how to set firm boundaries with friends that don’t excite either party. No one can adequately state in writing what it is you should say to your parents when you know they love you, but you can’t remember if they like you. And not even my rolodex of therapists from the past four years could pin down exactly what intuition feels like.

It’s these questions and their respective situations that allowed me to take full advantage of the independence I gained when leaving home. In both positive and harmful ways, I surprised myself. I took control of my circumstance in the best way I knew how, but there was always something left when everything was said and done; something I didn’t anticipate.

Whether it be the first full day I went without thinking of someone who had broke my heart, the strength that I somehow harbored to accept an apology from a friend without dismissing the harm that was caused, or the peace that I feel in the arms of someone I once swore off completely, I found myself in a place I couldn’t have predicted. 

In statistics (stay with me, this will be simple I think), there is an important concept called remainders (sometimes errors) that arise from performing linear regression (trying to connect data points, line of best fit, what have you). Basically, if we are given a cluster of points in a generally linear pattern, we usually want to draw an exactly linear line that predict the trend of the points. However, because of a number of factors, the line rarely passes through each point exactly and the space that’s left between a point and this line is called the remainder. 

When we try and connect the data points of our actions in order to plot the linearity of our progress, life and our limitations as human beings make it so that there are remainders all over the place. While it is important that we strive for positive progression, and it should be noted that too much variance in our actions is undesirable for obvious reasons, I would argue that some of our greatest lessons, incentives for change, and proudest moments can be found within our remainders.
