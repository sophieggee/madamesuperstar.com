title: "An Ode to Consumption"
image: header.jpg
---

I am currently in a period of grappling with questions such as: “Do I even have anything to say at all, let alone publish to the internet?”, “Is this embarrassing?”, “No matter how much I claim to believe I am not a particularly talented writer, does the very existence of this platform uncover any of the bases of my dignity I aim to protect by saying so?”, you get it.

I write this not for the sake of cultivating pity, please do not respond with any rebuttals. I am working on becoming completely comfortable with the fact that I might write something that, in the eyes of some (maybe even most), does not warrant a blog post. I want to sit with the idea that several people could be embarrassed on my behalf. And by definition, having and promoting this blog in any way implies that I believe someone may benefit from my ideas if not my writing. And I don’t want that to make me as scared as it does.

This fear is totally useless.

While I work on remembering why I started this blog in the first place, and formulate ideas that help feed my creative yearnings, I will use this interim period to promote consumerism, as any honest woman would.

I have been following the journalist [Haley Nahman](https://haleynahman.substack.com/) for some time now, and have always really enjoyed her “15 Things I Consumed This Week” newsletter. I can’t think of very many people who could send me their version of this that wouldn’t intrigue me, so here we are.

I have come up with 20 items/ ideas/ pieces of media I consume that feel pressing enough to recommend.

## 1. Bel Canto by Ann Patchet
![Bel Canto](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/bel-canto.jpg "Bel Canto")

I have read three of Patchet’s books this past year (Tom Lake, Dutch House, Bel Canto) all of which came highly recommended by my mother, an avid fan. I particularly enjoyed this piece because of its unique plot and emotional depth. I found that it discusses love (in all forms) as it transcends class, gender, race, and language. If you felt moved by the scene at the Opera in Pretty Woman, this novel is basically a 318 page ode to Opera as a form. Beautiful and thought-provoking, what more can you ask for??

## 2. [UW’s Rainy Dawg Radio Station](https://rainydawg.org/)

I’ll admit, I tuned in to this station in hopes for a shoutout from the DJ, a long time close friend. But I have been coming back for seconds! I haven’t listened to the radio since I owned a car, and even then it was only in dire situations. This radio station is student run and the song selections are eclectic while still remaining in my wheelhouse. While music taste is too personal for confident prescriptions, I have thoroughly enjoyed hearing these volunteer DJs (mostly college-age boys) be brave and indulge in a hobby they’re passionate about. From the orchestrating of setlists to the interspersing of facts both personal and informative, this artistic process is scary and inspiring. If you have the time, tune in on Mondays at 4:00-5:00 pm PST to hear Owen take risks and have fun between songs.

## 3. [The Prima Donna Musical Number from Phantom of the Opera (2004)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMPdczoLW_c)

## 4. [This Owala Water Bottle](https://owalalife.com/products/freesip?variant=44898561786015)

![Water](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/owala.png "Water")

This past month, I bought my fourth Owala water bottle. I have lost two and broken one on the floor of the subway. I don’t know that I am necessarily tied to this colorway but I am less afraid I will lose this one. I prefer Owalas over Hydroflasks because of the straw, carrying handle, and because I find that the mouthpiece valve is easier to clean than that of a strawed Hydroflask. I will not be giving the Stanley cup the dignity of comparison here as I believe the two serve completely separate purposes. But for a water bottle I carry around the city almost every day, this seems to be the winner every time. And yeah, they’ve got me with those color options, sue me.

## 5. [These Shoes](https://www.kickscrew.com/products/onitsuka-tiger-mexico-66-thl7c2-9399?variant=41425355768003&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&currency=USD&gad_source=1&wm_source=google&wm_medium=ads&wm_campaign_id=21160033806&wm_source=google&wm_medium=ads&wm_ad_id=&wm_adgroup_id=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpNuyBhCuARIsANJqL9O0jbJPU4f4JMKSk1Z2bX_IWZFmlYRlY5-1qqhO9GeOkkva5A4ad1QaAubIEALw_wcB) 

![Shoes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/onitsuka.png "Shoes")

I have them in silver but I would endorse any variation. They are immediately comfortable, low profile, and I believe they’ll stand the test of a good few years. 

## 6. [This Take on the Friendship Bracelet](https://www.diptyqueparis.com/en_eu/p/eau-capitale-perfumed-bracelet.html)

![Smells Good](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/diptyque_bracelet.png "Smells Good")

Some friends got me this for my birthday last month and it is an unexpected hit. I love the grounding nature of constantly having something to smell. I hope this scent will take me back to the memories I am making now, and it’s special as an accessory because it acts as a friendship bracelet with anyone I dispense a string for. The scent lasts a couple of days and the dispenser acts in a similar way to floss, cutting a piece at any desired length.

## 7. [Dazzle Dry Nail Polish](https://dazzledry.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpNuyBhCuARIsANJqL9NwEG0KAkYPcVjnnU5mbj7R_FnJZlR7Xrh1s-xHYBhggMputfPOd-4aAr0cEALw_wcB)

![Dazzle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/dazzle_dry.png "Dazzle")

If you have been within ten feet of me anytime in the past six months, you know how much I believe in this product. It’s totally changed the nail game for me. Each layer of paint dries within five minutes, which makes doing my nails significantly less of a chore and prevents the previously inevitable pre-dry smudge or chip. The color lasts a full week and I am always excited to try out a new color.

## 8. Daily 50 Knee Push-Ups 

I started this routine with my former roommate who is getting married this week. We both constantly find ourselves in the pursuit of The Toned Arm: every self-actualized modern woman’s aspiration. With a set end date in mind (her wedding) embarking on a journey of 50 push-ups a day felt more manageable. It has proved to be a stabilizing practice of self-care and activity. I can’t say for sure that these are what’s making a difference in my arms, but I will say that any amount of concentrated physical activity makes me feel more appreciative of and connected to my body.

## 9. [Deleting Social Media](https://www.getignite.org/)

I have been wanting to take a break from all forms of social media for a while now, and this startup spearheaded by my inspiring and hardworking best friend [Macy Dial](https://www.linkedin.com/in/macydial) became the perfect catalyst. [Her story](https://getignite.substack.com/p/my-social-media-story) is much more thoughtful and articulate than I could write here, but I will say that the past month has been a refreshing reminder of the present. As scary as it is that this is the product of deleting these apps, I can feel my brain rewiring. The active ebb and flow of reaching for my phone in a moment of desired documentation, released as I remind myself of my priorities and question my intentions. It’s good for the soul. I have agreed to be a Summer Off Socials Leader, so indulge me, and sign up [here](https://www.getignite.org/)

## 10. A Haircut

![STevo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/haircut_stevo.jpg "STevo")

I went to the infamous Stevo in Provo for my most recent cut, but almost anyone can benefit from the fresh start a haircut simulates.

## 11. [This Face Oil](https://www.dermstore.com/supergoop-daily-dose-hydra-ceramide-boost-spf-40-30ml/13521539.html?affil=thgppc&kwds=&thg_ppc_campaign=71700000113713367&adtype=pla&product_id=13521539&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpNuyBhCuARIsANJqL9OcHIPgJIY083B2TXK_kczmvEWVgsTFA3RzPl8XIqZdhSakvd7ys9AaAhr2EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)

![Supergoop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/supergoop.png "Supergoop")

I will take this space to recognize the privilege I have of clear skin. But I will say, since first using this sunscreen oil two years ago, I have noticed a major difference in the way my skin feels, how makeup sits/ lasts on my face, and the amount of compliments I receive on the “glow” of my screen. It’s my one ride or die face product. If you try it out, let me know what your thoughts are.

## 12. Journaling (I Don’t Want it to Work Either)

But it does. I journal nearly every day and have found that even an offhand stream of consciousness list can help stimulate both the logical and creative sides of my morning brain. Not to mention the priceless gift that is documentation of past memories and emotions. I often bring my journal to therapy to better understand a situation from both my perspective at that time and my view on things since.

## 13. [This Website for Sustainability](https://goodonyou.eco/)

Ever since being frustratingly radicalized by [this documentary](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/brandy-hellville-documentary-allegations-bombshells-hbo-max-1235004131/) I have been more cognisant of my apparel intake. I have found this website to be useful for explanatory ethical/environmental ratings of most brands, and hope to continue to abide by higher standards going forward.

## 14. The Monet Collection at the Met

It’s fabulous and peaceful. There are benches for meditative viewing and I love the way the sunlight hits some of the painting through skylights.

## 15. [These Pens](https://www.dickblick.com/items/pentel-arts-hybrid-technica-pen-03-mm-extra-fine/?clicktracking=true&wmcp=pla&wmcid=items&wmckw=21014-2003&country=us&currency=usd&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpNuyBhCuARIsANJqL9OdOkT5LHyyLMyTrxFH4ECaT2_L_y7vlfOSCXqhxid1tNEQb1_UOWkaAmLNEALw_wcB)

![PEn](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/pen.png "PEn")

Have ruined me for any other pen forever.

## 16. [This Fleece](https://sundae.school/collections/fleeces/products/broccoli-fleece-zip-up-collab-x-paulo-pastel?variant=45419571380470)

![Jacob Elordi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/tiger_mom.jpg "Jacob Elordi")

I bought this for myself over Christmas and have probably worn it 4-5 times a week since. Both my sister and her girlfriend have the same fleece in different patterns and feel similarly. It’s so much warmer than any other non-down jacket I own while still being lightweight and completely comfortable. I think it’s chic and fun and I can’t see myself rotating it out of my closet anytime soon. 

P.S I recently met the owner of the brand at a party and he is just as fun as his products imply.

## 17. Riverside Park

## 18. [This San Francisco Croissant](https://arsicault-bakery.com/home)

![Croissant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/croissant.jpg "Croissant")

I had it only once three months ago and I can’t stop thinking about the next time one will grace my salivating mouth with its presence. 

## 19. This Handout on Radical Acceptance

![RAD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/rad.png "RAD")

I first heard of radical acceptance through my therapist a couple of months ago, but I have found the practice of following these steps to be both humbling and relieving. It’s certainly not easy or simple, but there is an empowering nature to submitting to the reality of life. 

## 20. [As Always, the App PicsArt](https://picsart.com/apps/)

![PicsArt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/7cd33c0/static/content/image/picsart.jpg "PicsArt")

Someone somewhere created an app that completes almost any vision I conjure. Using this app is what I think of when someone asks me what I lose track of all time doing, and I’m tired of pretending otherwise.
