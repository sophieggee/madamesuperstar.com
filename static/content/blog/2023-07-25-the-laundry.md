I recently have settled myself into an apartment in a quieter corner of a loud city. With this new stage has come a world of small adjustments in areas of everyday life that I didn’t think to account for. One particular change is that I now have to take my laundry across the street, where I walk prepared with tide pods and $14 in quarters to do one load every five days. 

Recently, my boyfriend moved downtown to a new build high-rise that along with its central air, contains in-unit laundry. In the name of saving myself the price of two New York City lattes, I decided yesterday to embark on the brave trek of carrying two very full bags of my clothes to and throughout Penn station. 

Due to the limited size of his brand new washer/dryer, doing my laundry at Grant’s apartment required me to wait there for 3.5 hours. Of course, as we know, there is no rest for the wicked (me doing my laundry). So I’m sitting on the bed writing in my journal when I realize the gravity of the sacrifice I am making for my dirty clothes, and how heightened my awareness of my clothing has become since moving to the city. 

I wrote, “I guess I can think of this process as a way to tend to and care for the same clothes that give me all they’ve got every other day of the week.” Which is exactly what it felt like for those hours yesterday. I thought about how I walked the laundry up and down multiple flights of stairs, separated them into different loads, and even fit in a small nap with a timer going off when it was time to switch from washer to dryer. It all felt very maternal for some reason.

Although I could go on for at least two more paragraphs about the details and tribulations of laundering in the city, that’s not what drove me to write this today. Almost as soon as I had the thought of my laundry metaphor, I realized how significant it was to me. 

Turning this weekly task into an honorable, tender chore that all of the sudden “only makes sense”, is actually one of my main talents on this planet. If I had a resume that was to be presented as a sort of cosmic defense of my contributions to the universe, my ability to find pleasure and romance in the ordinary would be highlighted as the top-line summary. 

The reason this specific timing and train of thought struck me so profoundly is because I was starting to forget this part of myself. I haven’t felt this special voice speak up in months. Months that contained days that seemed at times like their sole intention was to drive home the point that this part of me had been cast out and done away with. “No more whimsy, as a rule” the days seemed to say. 

And so here I was, and I know it seems silly and even entirely against my central belief system, but I was about to redact the boldened summary from my cosmic resume. I was about to proclaim, if to no one other than myself, that I was no longer the kind of human that could contribute helpful nonsense. 

I guess when you experience enough hopeful mornings that have the door shut in their face almost as fast as you can brush your teeth, it starts to feel like it might be better if you just stop promising the world you can do anything other than survive.

And I don’t know that there’s even anything wrong with editing resumes. Sometimes all we need is a little less pressure to feel like we can stomach the task of blooming. And sometimes forces entirely out of our control practically hold the pens in our hands for us and demand we change the verbiage to past-tense. This is all possible, and as far as I can tell, part of the human experience.

But what I wanted to write about today is the beautiful feeling of temporary serendipity that can come with spotting a piece of evidence that the top-line summary still stands. I am not sure when or if I will get back to a seamless dance of **Being Myself**, or at least the **Myself** that I’ve known for 22 years. I am not sure if circumstances will continue to forge their way into my attempts at living and I will have to change my resume altogether, finding new things I can succeed at, and highlighting my “strength” and “endurance” as new skills I’ve unlocked. 

But for now, because my brain took me to a place it used to always visit, I am feeling hope that I can re-inhabit a mind and body that I find exquisitely familiar. And I’m even probably returning to her with new LinkedIn badges.
