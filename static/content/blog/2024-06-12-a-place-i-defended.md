A little over a year ago, when a tangible apartment in New York City was still just a dream of mine, I wrote in my journal, “I don’t care if the walls of my upcoming, big city apartment are alternating yellow and blue so long as there’s a tree in sight outside of my window.”

I got what I dreamed of, and with it came so much more.

I used to fantasize about finding a lover with a bond passionate enough to empathize with Mitski’s lyrics: “I don’t need the world to see that I’ve been the best I can be, but I don’t think I can stand to be where you don’t see me.” But I was listening to the song the other day when I realized that I was imagining my apartment as the audience of those lines.

This apartment took me in one Monday night in June with only a mattress on the ground. Too tired to install the pre-delivered air conditioning unit, my sleep was a breathless heap of exhaustion. 

Jenny Slate writes, “I’m like someone limping away from a fight that she won by just a hair. I may even be playing dead just so they don’t try to find me. I’m going toward a land that I have defended but not even lived in yet.”

What a precise description of my state upon arriving in this apartment. 

In fact, in different words, I have expressed similar sentiments on this very blog. In [December of 2022](https://madamesuperstar.com/home-for-the-holidays) I wrote (about coming home for the holidays), “It feels like I made it here on my dragging knees and with all of my insides in my arms falling out on either side like when you have too much mail to carry in from the car. I made it here just barely, by the skin of my teeth, or whatever they say.” 

And in [April of 2023](https://madamesuperstar.com/empire-state) in defense of a land I had not yet lived, I wrote, “When I live in New York City, I’ll do what I always do, and it will be in my favorite place I’ve ever been, and that will just have to do.” 

The emotions surrounding my move are hard to summarize. Upon graduating college, I found myself in a newly dark place. 

The newness of this grief was specifically frustrating because I thought I had plenty of experience with heartache, rejection, existential questioning, the gravity of disappointing my parents, and overwhelming stress. Nothing I was feeling at the time was terribly groundbreaking. Besides, I’ve always loved change, right? And anyone who’s heard me pontificate about my future has heard me dream of New York, so why did that one-way flight land on the most devastating of all tarmacs? 

Other than inexplicable chemical imbalances in my brain, my strongest hypothesis is about a transfer of energy. In order to start my life in this apartment, I was forced to sacrifice big parts of my past. Whether inevitable or not, I was no longer receiving an education in the way I had spent 18 years growing accustomed to, nor receiving any sort of financial support from my parents, and the initial decision to move out here came at an emotional cost to my family as well.

Still today, I sacrifice $1700 each month to the Rent Gods, three hours of time zone difference each day from family and loved ones, any respite I once received from silence or the ease of everyday tasks, in-unit laundry, and a temperate climate.

It makes sense that the more you put aside for something or someone, the more you expect in return. But, I think one of life’s worst lessons is learning that this transaction is not zero sum. The more miserable I am in the humidity of New York summers does not equate to more satisfying nights out, or long lasting friendships, or whatever it is that I might hope for in return. It just doesn’t always all shake out in the wash.

Learning this lesson from the city made for a brutal summer, and everything I was doing was in defiance of this heartbreaking truth.

I immediately channeled my feelings of misunderstanding and unrealized expectations into transforming the space around me. I found pieces in need of upcycling off Facebook Marketplace, got to work on painting and paper mache projects, and frequented the corner hardware store.

My journal entry from June 25th, 2023 reads, “Piece by piece, I build a room around me, half hoping that if I set the scene just right, the room will physically call me back. It needs me to feel at home so it can feel complete.”

There was such urgency to the settling in of this apartment for me. 

I knew something wasn’t right, I felt lost, and I needed something to do with my hands while I faced this reality.

My bedroom and the living room and the air-conditionless kitchen watched me that summer as I completely recalibrated.

I started to set important boundaries within shifting relationships, and was able to take myself out of a loveless situation. Just as the leaves grew golden, I started to recognize more and more of what I wanted and came to understand why.

My bed and the beds of my roommates cradled my mourning head as I sobbed through the wake of a breakup. My roommates gave me space to breathe and dance and we cooked meals. We always had something to go to or someone to be with. 

My bedroom tended to me as much as I tended to it. With the brisk weather, I took out the AC unit and changed out my bedding. In return, I was granted a warm haven where I could light candles and listen to Jeff Buckley and Bright Eyes. I vacuum my room every three days, there is space for all of my knick knacks. 

Winter’s steady march into Spring solidified my confidence in this living situation. When I walk out my door, more often than not, I will spot a familiar doorman or neighbor on the way to my destination. Each new connection like a root to my hopeful blossom. 

Today, for my one year anniversary of this great migration, I watched the New York Philharmonic Orchestra play in the Great Lawn of Central Park. Just as the roar of strings was building, a plane flew out of JFK overhead. 

I found myself very briefly sick to my stomach at the thought of being on that outbound flight.

In my year, I have given to Manhattan and I have taken from Manhattan. In seasons when I need unconditional support and a place to return to, I have been able to rely on this home. Like an unconventional and even at times reluctantly nurturing mother, Apartment #1 took me in and kept me warm for just long enough to send me back out into my days, kicking and dancing.

Every day a grateful performance in showing my home that “I’ve been the best I can be”. 

With all of these parts of me she’s seen and somehow taught me, I can’t bear the idea of her not seeing who I become. How beautiful I find it that she continues to watch.
