It was so embarrassing, middle school. 

That word feels flat when written out but I can’t think of a more prominent emotion of the three years which constituted my middle school experience. I don’t think my full self will ever be entirely detached from the stomach turns of navigating those hallways. 

These days, I find myself feeling genuinely, unmistakably embarrassed about once a month. Every so often I will get caught up in a miscommunication via text or cut in line by accident or discover I am nonconsensually unmuted. But in the vast array of emotions I feel on a weekly/monthly basis, embarrassment turns out to be somewhat (thankfully) negligible. 

On the occasion that I do find myself blushing or timid, I am immediately reminded of a self I used to inhabit. I become small in so many ways, suddenly I am in desperate need of explaining myself entirely.

“No no, don’t worry, please don’t worry, you have misunderstood, stranger! I am not the type of person who would do x, see if you would only know exactly what happened in my brain that led you to believe I was doing x, you would know that I am only acting logically and remember? This is who I really am! So just go ahead and wipe that version of me, the one you saw or thought you saw doing x, right out of your gorgeous brain! Don’t worry, please remember, I’m just like someone who behaves correctly. Do you get it now? Can we still be friends?”

It’s excruciating, of course. And more than that, it’s absurd. 

As soon as I become embarrassed at the idea of someone thinking I might have done or said something I didn’t intend for, I begin running for mayor of the psyche of someone I may not even care to impress in the first place. Immediately, whether or not I like or want to be friends/ care about a future with this person becomes completely irrelevant. All hands on deck – I must protect the person I want to be perceived as. 

What’s even more unbelievable than this (seemingly universal) truth, is that it was my daily reality for three years: middle school.

Daytrading bids for attention and friendship.

Before I even had a chance to distinguish which people were worth time or space in my brain, it was decided for me. There were arbitrary and unspoken rules that dictated which elementary schools churned out the best of the bunch, and everything after that was a rat race. Of course, extracurriculars and summer sports programs helped many enter sixth grade with a leg up. A certain type of mom attracted others of her kind, which set those offspring up for success. Some latchkey children had access to “resources” far earlier than is ideal, but contributed to social capital gain all the same. 

I, a devoutly religious, already 5’9”, reformed gifted program attendee (the only one of my kind, everyone else in the program chose to continue on to its subsequent middle school) from an undesirable elementary school and an even less desirable neighborhood, was not exactly a high-yield investment. 

During my years in the gifted program, I was asked to hang out with my peers outside of school on four separate occasions. Otherwise, my social circle consisted of my two best friends from my previous elementary school: Yara and Kate. We lived near each other, which helped, but I could tell there was something different about our interactions than the ones I would see happening from the other side of the playground at the recesses where my program was “integrated” with the rest of the grade level. 

The girls were wearing Uggs, Lululemon’s children's brand, and North Face (almost exclusively). They shopped at Nordstrom (sometimes alone – their moms in the other stores of the mall), put semi-permanent feathers in their hair, and traveled to Hawaii for mid-winter break. 

Yara and Kate and I rarely, if ever shopped together. We spent our days making “youtube” videos using accents that would never be published to any public forum. Our big adventures usually entailed going to Microsoft corporate offices with Kate’s dad after hours, or spending far too long at the mall with Yara’s entire extended family.

Don’t get me wrong, I can only feel warmth when recounting the memories I share with those two. And thankfully, we have a good portion of our experiences documented (for my posterity!). But even by 12 years old, I knew this sort of behavior was not going to do us any favors in gaining middle school popularity: an existential goal on par with eternal life.

All of this is to say, walking in those front doors on my first day of sixth grade was starting at ground zero. To make matters worse, within the first week of school, I endured a life-altering social devastation.

One day at lunch, something came over me that allowed me to brave sitting at the cool kids table. I was watching a group of boys, none of which could have been above 5 feet nor discovered their need for deodorant yet, most of which are now in real estate, pass a Gatorade bottle back and forth between them.

I can still feel how nervous I was. Watching the cool blue ping pong back and forth with shy laughter, surveying the other girls to know what behavior is most appropriate when it happened: The unopened Gatorade bottle, with full force, hit me directly in the (and I use this term as generously as it can be applied) boob. 

The same act would probably sting a little today, but in that moment, working with buds just beginning to sprout, and certainly not wearing any protection, I was in some pain. 

Which would have been fine if not for the World’s Most Popular (already) 13-year-old girl, with her Barbie-Goes-to-the-Beach olive skin and long, straight, silk brown hair who decided to be a social justice warrior and speak up for the underserved. 

“You guys! Hitting a girl _there_ really hurts, everyone apologize to - what was your name? - Sophie, right now”

To this day, I cannot believe I didn’t immediately fake an illness to be valiantly retrieved by my stay-at-home mother (who surely would have complied, given the circumstances). 

I am not exaggerating when I say surviving any single day in and out of those doors was a victory in and of itself. Between those unapologetic bell rings, almost anything could happen to your social life. Let alone the business that would take place in post-trading hours. 

Mornings on the bus in the crickety gray leather bench seat in the back, spent sliding and un-sliding my Samsung Touchscreen Keyboard Cell Phone anxiously anticipating any sort of an invitation regarding the impending weekend. 

The first time I was invited to hang out with new friends outside of school was the week before halloween. I was set to hang out at one friend’s house while a couple of other girls were at a house just down the street baking cookies and playing coolmathgames. The friend I was with suggested we join forces and got us invited to the other house rather casually, as they were all a part of the same friend group in elementary school. 

I nervously contributed what I could to a conversation between five friends with six years of friendship between them. I helped the one at the desktop computer avoid falling off the neon surface into oblivion and when dinner ideas were bounced around, I agreed with anything suggested. 

Eventually, my initial invitee left for family dinner and I was left alone en route to our local strip mall’s authentic Mexican gem, “La Casita” with four girls who hadn’t directly opted in to the idea of me joining their evening: my Big Break.

After filling my stomach with approximately my body weight of chips and salsa and sprite, we headed back home for a game of sardines in just about the largest house I had ever been.

After a couple of rounds, I was elected sardine. I found a bathroom on the second floor that seemed suitable, and made my lanky body as small as it could be in the space between the toilet bowl and the roll holder. I can’t remember how long I held strong, but before anybody had the chance to find me, I was throwing up.

I have thrown up four times in my whole life, and this night was one of them. 

When the first couple of girls found me, they shrieked in horror. Threatening to throw up themselves should they bear to stand by any longer.

As quickly as I could flush the toilet, the game had concluded, and I was encouraged to be driven home by the very comforting mother, who was probably reflecting then on the treacherous social battlefield I was failing to navigate. 

Another time that comes to mind when tracing my scars of puberty happened a few years later. I was more established in the scene by that point. And by that, I mean that Ms. Barbie no longer needed to be reminded of my name, but I certainly was not raking in a notable amount of social currency. 

Being established by no means brought security. Any day of any week could bring the termination of virtually any of my friendships for reasons that escaped me then and definitely wouldn’t hold up in any logical social court. 

One day, I decided to invite some girls over to my house for the first time. It was a Saturday, which meant something I was wary of, that my brother Sam would be joining us from his assisted living residency. Sam wasn’t violent every single week, and most of the time he could be occupied with a few runs of Alice in Wonderland. So while I was nervous, I figured it was a safe bet to stay around the house with my two friends.

About an hour in, Sam started screaming his familiar, guttural falsetto. A sound that I haven’t yet heard replicated in nature. I think the best way I can describe it is like the screaming cry of a small bird. You can hear the tears in it when he cries. 

Not all of his screams are the same, just like anyone, he has a range of emotions that lead him to outrage. But on this particular Saturday, I remember him being more sad than angry. 

He started to pull at his hair from the kitchen - only a room away from my friends and me. I knew what was next: biting his index finger and clawing at his forearm. He bounded side to side in a slow gait as he walked into the living room where he found us. But I knew he was only concerned with me.

The problem was, I didn’t know how to explain to them that I’ve never seen him hurt anyone who wasn’t family. I knew they were safe, but how could I convince them of that? What do you do when you’re the least sure of yourself that you will ever be, your body doesn’t feel nearly yours, and you haven’t even thought of fear as an option for the docket of this carefully curated high-stakes hangout?

How do you watch two people who you deeply yearn for (if only because you are supposed to) watch in complete fear and disgust as your brother performs his usual, but never less devastating, dance of anguish? 

How do you try and console him as you’ve seen your parents do a hundred times? How can you do that? You’re only 13.

How can you console him without taking the risk of being hurt, breaking skin. How do you take this experience away from people who can’t handle it? Why should you have to?

What would happen to them as they watch you be attacked? Because that’s what it is, isn’t it, an attack?

What do they make of these sounds? These sounds you’ll still hear in your sleep a decade later.

Will they ever want to come over again? Will the fear ever subside? 

I recognize the gravity of the scenarios I have laid out doesn’t necessarily steady a level scale. I guess it makes sense to me to group them all together because they were all a part of it for me. They were all things that made me deeply embarrassed. That’s what it was to me then.

When you’re faced with the task of surviving the stakes of middle school, traumatic experiences become the chore of minimizing themselves until they fit under the rug. It’s not about comforting yourself as you endure heartache or tragedy, it’s about erasing any otherness you contain.

That’s what is necessary when the ultimate goal is: fitting in.

Of course, written out in broad daylight and ten years later, I understand how upside down it all seems. I know I could spend hours preparing a dissertation to describe the many reasons for which this goal is irrelevant and more than that, prohibitive. 

I would grab that 5’9” Sophie Grace who opts out of lake days because she isn’t allowed to wear two piece bathing suits, dumbs herself down for anyone who will listen, and cries at the end of that Saturday not for her brother or for herself, but for her friends (please let them still be her friends) by the shoulders. I could remind her how much she means, how proud of herself she could be, how deeply _good_ she is, and how little any of this will matter in only a couple of years. But I know it would all be wasted breath.

When we’re in middle school, there is no shortage of lectures from wise veterans on the importance of self-worth and kindness and grace. I can’t tell you how many times I was told that this social warfare wouldn’t “matter” later. But I can tell you how useless that is to hear in the moment. It didn’t help me then and I imagine there is a fair amount of similar advice that can’t help me now.

I wish I could grab her by the shoulder, if only for a hug. 

While I can’t, I’ll choose to do the next best thing.

I think I’m going to try to remember her each time I find myself turning red, hastily explaining myself, surveying the lunch room at work for a place to sit, or spilling on myself on a first date. 

I’m going to try and keep an eye out for the current renditions of Throw-Up-at-Your-First-Big-Break or Gatoradegate 2012. I hope I remember that those experiences won’t go by faster or somehow be remedied as I spend time kicking myself over them, reworking them in my brain. I bet one day I’ll be able to write out my current experiences and emotions as a narrative based on memory and find that I still have some things upside down.

Even keeping that 13-year-old in mind, I’ll continue to find myself embarrassed and ashamed. Wishing things had gone differently, or that everyone could see my intentions like a flashing neon sign above my head. And when that happens, there’s little left to do other than pick ourselves up and drive ourselves home, with comfort in each stride.
