The past month has been one of the best in my 24 years. In trying to describe why or how I feel, two distinct images have come to mind.

The first is the montage of Jennifer Garner’s character in 13 Going On 30, after she finds herself (still equipped with the mind and soul of a 13-year-old) in the body of a 30-year-old professional living in a one-bedroom apartment in a desirable neighborhood of Manhattan, with a designer-filled walk-in closet and her dream job. She is both completely shocked by the supernatural events she’s experiencing and elated to learn of her new fabulous reality.

My apartment, in a more affordable neighborhood in Manhattan, is a four-bedroom that I share with three other people, and my closet is so small and packed that I have to do some serious rearranging each time I want to access my far-from-designer clothes—which I do every morning as I get ready for my less-than-sexy job as a software engineer. Notwithstanding, I find myself internally screaming and jumping in that signature Jenna Rink way all the same.

Another visual comes from Dolly Alderton’s book Everything I Know About Love.

She writes:
 “To this day, I have never, ever been able to get over the fact that I don't need to drink gin from shampoo bottles anymore; that there is no lights-out; that I can stay up watching films or writing until four a.m. on a weeknight if I want to. I am relieved, energized, invigorated that I can eat breakfast foods for dinner, play records really loud, and have a cigarette out of my window. I still can't quite believe my luck. My entire life as a young twenty-something adult was lived like Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York when he finds himself booked in at The Plaza and orders mountains and mountains of ice cream from room service and watches gangster movies.”

When I first read this excerpt a year ago, I remember that it did not resonate with me at all. I felt like adulthood came into my life at a point where it was expected and natural, and I didn’t grow up in a way where I felt confined at all.

In fact, as I did gain independence by moving out of my college town and starting my first grown-up job, I found it to be a rude awakening. I won’t restate the emotions that came with this transition, as I have written about them [here](https://madamesuperstar.com/earth-rotating), but I was expecting to feel more Jenna Rink × Macaulay Culkin than I did.

I wonder if the fact that adulthood and its lack of constraints was never something I yearned for means that it took longer for me to appreciate what I now have. What I mean by this is that, as Alderton describes in her memoir, she was always counting down the days until she had no curfew, no dependencies, and nowhere to be. I can’t relate to that. My childhood never felt like a burden to me in those ways, and I remember really liking the order that came with school and tending to my family unit.

So when I first moved to New York and was officially financially—and otherwise—independent, I didn’t think of my agency and abundant new opportunities as a part of something I had been so desperately hungry for. If anything, I felt my new choices weigh heavy on my mind and heart. I remember the release of a strict schedule and the absence of a quantifiable goal (my GPA, getting a job, graduating, classes to attend, etc.) as being incredibly overwhelming.

I am grateful that my 13-year-old self would wake up as the 24-year-old I am today and want to go back home immediately. I am happy to know that I had a childhood I was excited to be a part of and that I never felt too constrained. This same knowledge sure would have saved Jenna Rink a 98-minute-long movie of learning to be satisfied with her own age.

However, Dolly Alderton’s “can’t quite believe my luck” mentality has been a frequent guest in my subconscious lately, and I can’t help but attribute my overall wellbeing to this mindset.

I’ve started noticing small things—like the other day, I was running to the corner store to grab popcorn and mini M&Ms (to celebrate the end of a Tuesday, c’mon!) and I slipped on my short, chestnut brown Ugg boots. I can’t even remember when in the past two years I bought these boots, and I don’t remember it being monumental in the slightest. I use them for their intended purpose, which is to be convenient slippers that are occasionally seen by the patrons of the local AMC—but no larger or more established audiences. Throwing on my slippers felt notable as I stopped to think about the complete euphoria I could have hand-delivered my 13-year-old self by gifting her a pair of these same boots.

I may not have spent every day of my childhood yearning to be an adult, but I did spend an embarrassing portion of it begging for Ugg boots.

I felt the same way when I walked into my high-rise gym this morning. When I visited the city in 2023, just a couple months before I moved here, I was able to go to this gym as a guest of my friend. I will never forget the first time I saw the weight room and the treadmills, to the backdrop of an Upper West Side skyline ping-ponging sunbeams between skyscraper windows. I hope I can remember that feeling as frequently as possible, and I am grateful when I do. Heaven knows I pay enough for the gym membership.

I recognize that $160 slippers and an Equinox membership are capital-P Privileges, and I don’t want my gratitude nor contentment to be tied to the monetary value of the life I live. I only offer these moments as examples of times I have been able to be fully transported into the giddy eagerness of a past version of myself.

I believe that accessing that truth is the key to what has made my month so spectacular. I have been incredibly fortunate in so many ways, including having the opportunity to visit some friends in California, travel with my sister and best friend to two of my all-time favorite places, host the birthday party of my dreams in the city of my dreams, and intersperse these events with visits from some of my very favorite people. But I have been lucky before, and thankfully, I have also had a lot of fun opportunities in the past. What I think has made these weeks so much more potent has been my patience and present mind as I remember to recognize the dreams I have had.

Of course, external factors completely out of our control (tragedies, mental illness, financial stress, demanding jobs, etc.) keep us from feeling as present as we may hope to, and we may not always be living a life we have dreamed up—which is okay. I have written plenty about that as well.

I guess what I am trying to acknowledge and keep record of is that I am struck by how genuinely grateful I feel right now—to casually and within my daily routine, live so many dreams come true.

The odds are that your past yearning doesn’t look exactly like Dolly Alderton’s, or Jenna Rink’s, or mine, or even Macaulay Culkin’s—but I wonder if you don’t have one thing in your current life, or one activity that you get to do often, that a past version of you wouldn’t believe is true. And if we can take a little more time each time we get to do those dream-come-true activities to remember the original dreamer, we will all be better off for it.
