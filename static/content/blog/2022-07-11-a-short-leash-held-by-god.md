## Some Far From Ground-Breaking Revelations:

I feel certain that the worship of a higher power is necessary for optimal progression in this life. And because I feel this about the world, I see submissions to deity everywhere I look.

I am not unique in my yearning for truth and direction.

<br/>

And although I have been told countless times, in countless ways, that this is precisely what God can do for us, it takes daily, active recall and prayerful meditation to re-center myself around this truth. 

While living a life completely led by God and without any need for control, in theory is the height of submission and peace, even the simple first steps of kneeling in sincere and honest prayer feel worlds away from me at times.

I know that the steps to enter this divine transfer of power start with me creating a space in my heart and head for God to dwell. If I want to be able to tap into this dialogue with deity at any time, and in any place, I will have to start with making sure God feels comfortable dwelling within me.

I am no stranger to nesting. Each school year brings a whirlwind of excitement for me as I Pinterest-board-envision my way toward an ideal and sacred space to rest my head. Which makes the idea of creating something similar in my life for God that much more enticing. 

If I can create a space within myself and in my day of honesty, compassion, and vulnerability as I open myself to posing and receiving answers from God (reading holy texts, meditating on poems, walking outside without headphones: strengthening the signal of divinity), then I will be able to humble myself in worship in a way that eliminates my ego from the equations of interaction. 

No longer will it be me making my decisions, but God.

Sometimes, when the weight of the world feels particularly present, and I am at a loss for even the slightest inspiration of what to wear – the notion of entertaining such a question feels frivolous – I put on my **All-White Jumpsuit**, and walk out into the day. 

In her daily two-way written prayer to God, _Eat, Pray, Love_ author Elizabeth Gilbert always asks, “Dear God, what would you have me know today?”.

One particular time, God responded with the words: “My favorite baby, I would have you know humility. I want you to know the sweetness and the deep, all-encompassing relief that humility will bring to your life. 

“Ask me to do things for you; that is what humility is. Admit that you are powerless over everything, and life will get easier. Say, ‘God, here, you do it’, and open up your mouth and I will do it. 

“Don’t make plans, my little love, let me arrange your life. 

“Pause, listen for me, and let me do it. 

“I don’t want you to miss this experience of letting go into love and trust. Let me do more things, let me dance you, let me live you, for you, 

“for you are mine, and I am thine.”

My relationship with the God of my understanding is the most important one I have and so often, it is neglected. But by taking the time out of every day, leaving the space in every conversation, and allowing silence in my heart for God to dwell alongside me, I will be able to remember and tend to this relationship with more intention. 

And maybe one day I will be dancing in the light of the sun, and I will realize that **it is God dancing me.**
