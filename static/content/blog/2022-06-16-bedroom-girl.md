I’ve always been a **Goal-Oriented Gal**. It was probably aided by my love of stationery, but I have been crafting daily to-do lists, “summer bucket list”s, goal sheets, and vision boards since I was sentient. I think I love this about myself. I can’t say that all of these manifestations have come to fruition, but I can say that they’ve been at one point immortalized in some form of cool-toned pink pen. And that is just about as commendable as it gets.

This summer had an unfamiliar undertone as it approached me. 

I could mark this time period in my life by the sheer amount of uncertainty that surrounds me, but what gets me so excited is the potential for growth and new understanding. You never touch the same river twice and stuff like that.

Reading Bell Hooks’ definition of True Love: *“The will to extend oneself for one’s own or another’s spiritual growth”* helped me shape the trajectory of this summer as one for discovering True Love in my own life: learning how I can come to know and heed it.

## This looks like:

- Finding a consistent quiet place outside near water or trees that can become a space for spiritual practices (prayer, meditation, journaling).

- Staying in communication with close connections to the extent that I am able to provide for them a resource for reflective growth and encouragement, but not past the threshold of being distracting or unproductive (for either party).

- Helping parents and family members in ways that don’t come naturally for me; serving others even when it is less convenient. 

- Giving myself the grace and space to feel appropriate emotions and learn what sorts of boundaries are most helpful and healing.

Aside from internal and existential contemplation, I have been enjoying the band CAKE, especially [their rendition of Doris Day’s "Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps"](https://open.spotify.com/track/056bAgyXJrvqWzESDcU4CJ?si=9c8e139e9c084367).
