Him being four years older, there were only two years of my elementary school career that overlapped with Eli’s. We lived about two miles from the school and, at least for my year in kindergarten, this meant he was burdened with the task of walking me home every day. Between prematurely learning what “giving someone the bird” meant and memorizing all of the lyrics to [The Killers’ "Somebody Told Me"](https://open.spotify.com/track/6PwjJ58I4t7Mae9xfZ9l9v?si=e2e4e53d2c9c43e6) to impress his _much cooler friends_, these walks occasionally provided space for me to confide in my more-seasoned walking companion.

One day, I had been experiencing some light bullying from a peer who, in hindsight, probably just had a kindergarten-style crush on me. Based on insights collected from the Nickelodeon canon, I thought that the right thing to do in this situation was present this problem to my 4th-grade brother.

Eli was not having any of it. The next day at recess, he made the valiant trek from the “upper” (grades 3-6) playground to my “lower” kingdom and asked me to point him in the direction of my offender. 

Face-to-face with Jake-from-Ms. Wilson’s-class, Eli informed him that picking on me was, “seriously not okay” and that he didn’t want to “hear of it happening again”. And with those cutting remarks, Eli (clad in a Garfield graphic tee) wished Jake a “good day” and returned to his jungle gym throne.

I can’t help giggling at this memory every time it moseys on over into my subconscious, specifically on the day of my senior year that Jake-from-Ms. Wilson’s-class signed for the marine corps. 

Eli showed up for me that day, and he hasn’t missed an opportunity to do so since.

I remember a particularly difficult day of my less-than-ideal freshman year of college. I had just been stood up for a date (one of very few that year) and spent most of the day coming to the conclusion that I was, in fact, **not** a girl who codes, and actually that no matter how pink and Polly-Pocket-reminiscent its case, I needed to be as far away from my computer as possible for the remainder of the night. 

I sat in my cinderblock-hoisted twin bed and sobbed to my mom over the phone, who must have been simultaneously texting Eli because before the call was over, he (along with four of his closest friends) was in my dorm hall parking lot. 

This motely crew took a very resistant and very red-eyed Grace to get cookies and made sure to drown out any negative thoughts I may have brought with me using the blasting sounds of "[Gasolina](https://open.spotify.com/track/228BxWXUYQPJrJYHDLOHkj?si=192581fd22cb4272)" and screaming hexes on the male species at large. 

Eli and I have our fair share of differences. But despite what five-year-old Grace would have told you in between various physical altercations, he is extremely gentle. He cares deeply about the world around him and its inhabitants.

And he is **always** just a proverbial jungle gym away.
