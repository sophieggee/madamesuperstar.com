**Thoughts on what to say for the toast**

it is so easy to feel at peace within the presence of camille

"to - it’s that thing when you’re with someone… and you love them and they know it… and they love you and you know it… but it’s a party… and you’re both talking to other people… and you’re laughing and shining… and you look across the room… and catch each other’s eyes… but - but not because you’re possessive… or it’s precisely sexual… but because… that is your person in this life. And it’s funny and sad, but only because this life will end, and it’s this secret world… that exists right there… in public, unnoticed, that no one else knows about." - Greta Gerwig

i have never felt so divinely comfortable as quickly as i did with camille 

i’ve never felt one reservation about sharing this precious person with someone as intentional as tommy

he’s the kind of person with a presence that you trust 

i’ve learned that when you are lucky enough to have someone this special in your life, the best thing you can hope for in their partner is that they will see and appreciate the same holiness that you always have. 

**Final Draft**

Thank you (if there’s someone to thank), I’d like to start off by addressing the elephant in the room, you guys may recognize my voice from Camille and my critically-acclaimed, chart-topping podcast: tiny room, big girls. I totally understand feeling excited, and I only ask that you wait until I finish eating to ask for pictures or autographs. 

Camille and I met where all soulmates do:  freshman year physical science. I remember the first time she invited me over to her house, coming prepared with some talking points and casual activities to maintain her interest. I soon learned, however, just how easy it is to feel at peace within the presence of Camille. I can’t recall another person with whom I have felt as divinely comfortable as quickly.

When I was lucky enough to share a 50 square foot room with her, I wrote this in my journal:

“I really do find it a special thing to share such an intimate space with Camille. I love her so much. I never get tired of seeing her or take our conversations for granted. Our relationship is just so precious to me.”

I’ll spare you the director’s cut version of my journal recitations, but let’s just say there are very few people I wax nearly as poetic about as Camille. And for good reason. 

~~So n~~Naturally, before meeting the love interest of a person of this caliber, I had my hesitations. I remember multiple occasions in which I would deliberate with mutual friends about how we could possibly find Camille a worthy companion, and who in the world would be deserving of her grace.

To say Tommy did not disappoint would be an understatement. Just as I had felt so uncharacteristically comfortable with Camille, I found a similar sense of ease and trust within the nearness of Tommy. ~~I even~~ Such ease, in fact, that I remember asking him to take out the contacts from my eyes just two weeks after we met. A famously tell-tale sign of upstanding character. 

*laughs of course, it’s silly that’s why*


Not only this, but I’ve learned that when you are lucky enough to have someone like Camille in your life, the best thing you can hope for in their partner is that they will see and appreciate the same holiness that you always have. 

To be with Tommy and Camille is to watch true compassion and tender connectedness. There is undeniable attentiveness that you can find within the pair even when they are engaged in separate conversations and across the room. ~~I am so grateful that Tommy recognizes the same shine that I’ve had the great pleasure of receiving even a fraction of in my years of knowing her.~~

I believe in the two of them with most everything inside of me, and I am one lucky lady to share Camille with such an unconditionally loving person. 

*turn to the happy couple*

I am so excited for you two, and I will always be grateful for the parts of your love that I have the privilege of experiencing. Here’s to many more years of your beautiful dance!

*Cheers*
