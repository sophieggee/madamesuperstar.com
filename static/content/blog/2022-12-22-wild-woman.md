The concept of wildness has been enticing to me ever since I heard Mitski sing that “[**wild women don't get the blues**](https://open.spotify.com/track/3sslYZcFKtUvIEWN9lADgr?si=0ec8c8c808cc4a48)”. Sign me up. But “wild” is one of those words that gets stuck in my throat. 

I have always had an innate propensity to perform. I put on plays and choreographed dance routines. And I didn’t usually let authority rain too heavily on my childhood parades. My parents often quote my 8-year-old self when describing the nature of my relationship with my father to my mom. I thought about it for a while and said, “sometimes I hear what dad says and think: ‘do I agree with that?’ and if I do, I’ll listen and if not, I don’t”. 

I’m not sure where I got my gall but I hope it’s nonrefundable. 

I’ve known about this uninhibited side of me for my whole life, but embracing her and tending to those desires has been far from encouraged. For a long time, I could only hear the word “wild” in my mom’s disapproving voice. The same tone as when seemingly settled down and buttoned up adults paint the picture of their reckless youths. It’s always spoken with a shaking head. 

But “a mistake has been made about wildness”. Jenny Slate writes about the idea of putting red geraniums indoors as houseplants rather than maintaining their original purpose in the wilderness. “A geranium is a wild thing. It is so wild you can hardly kill it. But it does not take over your house if you put it inside.”

Reading about parts of myself as interpreted as pieces of nature helped me to shift my perception of wildness. I was born really excited about making a lot of noise. And I knew the way I felt about my body when it started dancing was special. I’ve always been able to say things to strangers that make my friends blush, but I never understood why. Growing up, I was told that my demeanor might be “overwhelming” to the untrained eye. All of this less than positive feedback made me question my wild tendencies. 

Maybe I should keep my sporadic instincts to the confines of my bedroom in the morning, or maybe I should make my compliments to strangers a little less specific and intense. Maybe I should listen to all types of authority because that is the Right thing to do. This would make me well-behaved and palatable. 

But what was confusing about this hypothetical to-do list is that completing it made me feel small. I knew I felt like something for the outdoors that shouldn’t be brought inside. But I also knew what I could do if someone loved me enough to try.

So instead of trying to hide the light of my wild, I have been thinking more about finding the perfect lampshade to bring a respectful amount of attention to the things it can do. Like filling a room with warm-colored life and love, or illuminating the emotions that could be poured into a postcard or birthday letter. 

Maybe if I dress her up in the right way, people will see that my wild can, and even should, be brought inside. Maybe they already have.
