You can cite my sources if you have a way of verifying with my roommate-parents, but this summer I would describe myself, among other things, as: **A Girl On The Phone**.

Being an average of 2,000 miles away from most of my closest friends and family, my summertime call logs would make Verizon Wireless weak in the knees.

Alongside the expected benefits of: 

- keeping up-to-speed with romantic, professional, and otherwise pressing goings-on
- sharing insights and holding each other accountable for summer goals
- giggling about absurd encounters from states away

that come with the territory of maintaining close friendships, I also experienced the delightful process of developing a few new friendships via weekly phone calls.

I am a particularly outgoing gal, and if you surveyed any poor soul who found themselves in the Stover Hall lobby in 2019, or on the other end of a first-date dinner table, you would find that I ask “[**Extremely Intrusive Questions**](https://vsco.co/phigrace/media/5da2bf586e5ac0673a9a315a)”. 

While the answers to these questions help me to better understand someone I know almost nothing about, they also contribute to feelings of discomfort and, in unfortunate cases, distrust from the recipient. 

I’ve even been perceived as seeking to “collect” others.

I’ve known the risks of the questions basically as long as I’ve been asking them, but the adrenaline of finding out that someone in my math class would put Dolly Parton on his [Personal Mount Rushmore](https://www.instagram.com/p/B6FhS9TlJhG/) helps the risks slip my mind more often than not.

So then it becomes a matter of combating these initial perceptions. I happen to know I am not a collector of people (obscure trinkets and delicate dishware? Absolutely. But not people), so how do I keep someone’s attention (and suspended trust) for long enough to convince them of the same?

Reflecting on the progression of our new friendships with my summer-phone-call-friends has contributed some valuable insight that I will now share with you: the few, the brave, blog constituents. 


1. **Asking for perspective on a personal problem helps to build trust and display humility.**

    In recounting the trajectory of my relationship with a more reserved and sophie-tentative labmate of mine, she mentioned that in the first couple of months of knowing me she “absolutely did not trust (me) at all”. She stated that there is, “no way someone can be that excited, that often” and chalked up my enthusiastic questioning to some twisted version of a _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ exercise left for the reader.

    I reminded her of a thoughtful note she had written me in the spring and asked her what might have contributed to this shift in tone. That’s when we remembered a uniquely bonding experience in the lab.

    One day, when the two of us found ourselves working alone, and in an effort to further procrastinate algorithm visualizations, I asked her for romantic advice.I presented her my problem, one that I had not yet shared with anyone else, and before I could finish, she was at the whiteboard drafting a decision matrix for me. 

    Not having engaged in many of my previous efforts, her interest in this conversation was unexpected and thoroughly appreciated. The matrix made us laugh, and even positively contributed to my romantic conquest, but its most important outcome was founded on the vulnerability required of me to pose the question.

    My labmate (consciously or not) recognized that I valued something specific to her when I asked for her input on my problem. And by genuinely engaging with her advice, I showed trust in her. 

    She’s a tough nut to crack, and I would argue that I’m still trying to win her over, but I do know that asking for her perspective contributed to the trust I’ve earned from her in a way that no amount of existential questioning could.

2. **Experiencing shared catharsis can strengthen trust and understanding.**

    This idea came from another summer-phone-call-friend of mine. His exact words were, “do you ever think that life wouldn’t be nearly as rich without catharsis specifically” followed by the caveat that, “obviously we don’t want to engineer situations that lead to it even if you might imagine that **experiencing catharsis with someone is the most alive you could be**” 

    A thought-provoking idea that I had never entertained.

    But that same night, driving home screaming a gnarly duet of [Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain”](https://open.spotify.com/track/2DnJjbjNTV9Nd5NOa1KGba?si=68e1296b4547425c) with my freshly-wronged sister, I realized I entertain it often.

    I am reminded of the origin story of one of my closest friendships (with a strong and silly lady that I have the great fortune of being an in-person-friend to this summer). We often jokingly credit an ex-best friend of ours for our closeness. In our sophomore year of high school, we shared the unfortunate experience of being left high and dry by someone in whom we had invested far too much emotional currency.

    I remember feeling apprehensive about reaching out to my now best friend during this draining experience. And even shyer about crying in front of her. But I knew I couldn’t discuss the specifics with anyone else, and that she would be painfully familiar with my feelings. And I am so grateful I did. Processing this trauma alongside someone trustworthy enriched and validated the experience. And I felt what is arguably the most important feeling in any unprecedented event: seen. 

    Not to mention the beautiful (and catharsis-rich) friendship it fostered.

3. **Acknowledging the work and growth of another is far more important than recognizing existing strengths/talent.**

    Sometimes, it’s not about the destination, but the friends we make along the way! Am I RIGHT, ladies!? 

    I actually heard this axiom in a podcast about the Danish Style of Parenting, but given the volume of podcasts and phone calls I am listening to, they start to blend together in a beautiful summertime waterfall of enlightenment.

    The idea was proposed in the context of raising children, but it can be used without loss of generality in successful friendships.

    One of the many rewards that come from gaining the trust of, and experiencing catharsis with a close friend is that eventually I may receive a compliment or two. Among these, I have noticed a pattern in my initial response.

    In fact, because I am insufferable, I even have a notes page entitled “the nicest things people have ever said to me”. Without exception, these compliments acknowledge an attribute I had been working on. Not only that, but they recognize the place I came from in my journey to exhibiting said attribute.

    I can pay this notes-app-worthy gratification forward by making a point to notice the things my friends are working on. I try to ask them about their goals and understand the places they’re starting from, so that when they experience achievement, I can appreciate its magnitude. 

    As the summer ends, I’m coming out of an especially transformative period of my life. I have experienced bouts of sorrow and confusion in the past couple of months and more often than not, I felt like I was handling the circumstances all wrong. Comparing myself to my own previously held expectations left me feeling dramatic and over reactionary. I knew I was coping with these events in the best way I could, and I knew that I was putting forth a greater amount of effort than I’ve ever had to before just to go about performing daily tasks. But it wasn’t until a dear friend told me that they were, “so proud of how hard I was working to change and grow” that I allowed myself to reflect on how far I had come. 

    I have had a couple of friends note that I am “so positive” about this all, or that I’m “doing a much better job” than they would in my shoes. Which, do not get me wrong, feels incredible to hear. But there is a certain burden that can only be lifted by the trusted recognition of real work, and I strive to be a small part of that lifting for those around me. 

_One phone call at a time._
