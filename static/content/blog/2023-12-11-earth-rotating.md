One of my closest friends, whom I have no doubt mentioned on any platform available to me, Haley McBride, recently shared with me her 2023 summary. It’s funny because reading the (rather eloquent) description of her year inspired me to reflect on mine in a way that seemed entirely novel. 

Somehow, even as my mailbox contains a handful of Christmas cards detailing years in review and my Spotify is telling me everything about my calendared psyche, I read Haley’s piece and felt like the idea of a year-end review was invented before my very eyes. Right there on the Google Doc she shared with me (I’m sure she’d share it with you too, for what it’s worth).

In years past, starting weeks in advance, I typically follow an unconscious agenda of re-reading all of my journal entries starting from January, play my past year’s top songs on repeat, decree an all-encompassing rebrand that will take care of my New Year’s Resolutions, and recenter myself with plenty of meditation.

I can’t exactly say what it is about right this moment that feels so far away from embarking on this journey. But as usual, I’ll try.

I started to reach for my journal in the spirit of “hitting the books” but realized I could practically quote the past 45 pages. I don’t particularly feel the need to add to my standing in the ranks of Phoebe Bridger’s listeners, and I can see my somewhat-recently published “Creed for a Girl” taped on my wall from where I am sitting on my bed.

Thinking about it now, I don’t think there have been two consecutive months this year that I went without revisiting past journal entries and/or grounding myself in a constitution. In a lot of ways, I think this continual draw to renewal is the only thing that’s kept me afloat.

I’m not interested in writing about the importance of self-redeclaration, as I have very recently done so. What does pique my curiosity, however, is why I have felt the need —- not desire -- to explore myself so fervently this year. And arguably even more enticing, what in the world have I learned in doing so?

This being my longest blog post to date, we’re going to have to keep this chatter to an outline (scary, I know) but I think we’ll have fun?

I intend to proceed by interspersing informative journal entries with explanatory takeaways, shedding some light on the situation that is my 2023.

This year I have had to defend my system of beliefs in ways I never have before, coming to terms with the changes I feel within me every single day. I’m so deeply entangled with the search for discovering which projection of Truth might work best for me. This struggle in my heart seeps into both the treacherous and the mundane. I have to visit it when describing where I went to school to the stranger in a crowded bar or the coworker at a too-silent kitchenette. I carry it with me through tears in conversations with loved ones or when using sterile terminology in hopes of bringing therapists rapidly up to speed. To write about my 2023 without acknowledging my search for a definition of faith where I find peace would not be writing about my year at all.

***<p style="text-align: center;">June 25th: “I feel so far from things I used to understand. I want to be a beacon of light. I want to bring those around me closer to the God they find in their lives. But I look around me and all I see are upturned roots. What am I supposed to do with all these questions?”</p>***

It’s brave what I’ve done just now. Like I said, I talk about this all the time, and it’s almost certainly the number one visited topic of my journal entries. But I think this marks the first time I’ve ever addressed my turmoil so publicly. I should note that by “so publicly,” I am aware that the ~20 people that read this are intimately aware of my existential ponderings. But I think bravery is a profound and hard-to-pin-down emotion and if I can’t identify it here, where can I?

Another notable cause of introspection is my graduation from adolescence: My Fall from Grace.

It would take a lot more bravery than previously addressed to dive into my grappling with coming-of-age in such specifics, but I should say that the acknowledgment of one’s own accountability in its entirety is no picnic.

***<p style="text-align: center;">August 3rd: “Apparently extended periods of time as short as 15 minutes in high decibel environments can lead to permanent nerve damage in ears. It sometimes feels that these past two years have contained so many unthinkable, unimaginably damaging days, and I start to wonder which of it all is permanent.”</p>***

For me, facing my faith in a new light will always feel hand-in-hand with my experience of discovering the world as an adult, but the two can and should be addressed as separate entities.

Becoming an adult feels like finishing act one of a play that I wholeheartedly appreciated from the orchestra seats only to find out that I am set to be the lead in act two.

I was plenty aware of my surroundings growing up, and I think I digested information from as wide of a breadth of resources as I had reasonable access to. Still, I find myself feeling back at square one more frequently than I would prefer. Even when I experience painfully similar emotions time and time again, almost cyclically, it takes thoughtful recounting and sincere introspection to identify patterns. August 3rd: “And all at once, today right now, I am angry. I’m angry with the patriarchy, of course, but not in a trite way; this time it’s new, like somehow I have found a creative way to curse the patriarchal threads of society. I am angry at anyone or anything that made me feel small when I didn’t deserve it. I’m angry at all the people that didn’t want to hear themselves accept me. And, as always, I’m angry at the hours that I spend feeling dramatic and ashamed—all riled up, as they say.”

You can watch the same play curtain to curtain as many times as you’d like and still have no idea what to do once you’re on stage yourself.

I guess I’ve turned to re-reading my journals and devouring self-help books during this period of my life as my own way of rehearsing the script.

***<p style="text-align: center;">December 9th: “I’m breaking with old patterns and moving forward with my life. Oh! And haven’t you heard? My creativity always leads me to truth and love. Today will be another day I successfully live through. Yes, there is plenty to mourn and there are places to wallow, but in a lot of ways, I have everything I need.”</p>***

The last part of this year I will discuss is my entering into America’s workforce (unexpected, I know).

In the transition between the almost mind-numbing challenge of my undergraduate career and what is now my full-time job in “Big Tech” (that’s what they’re calling it), I have found that I have much more time

 on my hands and space in my head.

***<p style="text-align: center;">June 25th: “Maybe I spend all my time creating new things because I find space in this creation for me to surprise myself. It’s as though I am coming up with a beautiful mosaic of pieces of me that I recognize.”</p>***

With this time and space, I have had the opportunity to read several more books, create a surprising amount of art, and write all the while. I’m so grateful to spend more time with myself in these ways.

My dad spent the past three months on sabbatical from his grueling job as an overworked attorney. My mom was at first nervous about the extra time on his hands and figuring out what to occupy him with, but the days have flown by and I think they’re more in love than ever before. At the very least, my dad is certainly the happiest I have ever seen him.

Sometimes we’re scared of more time because we haven’t had the opportunity to discover what it can bring us. I’m just grateful I can commute home from Times Square slightly before rush hour and find my paper mache supplies waiting for me on the kitchen table.

***<p style="text-align: center;">November 11th: “I am also grateful that reading back on old journal entries gives me a sense of patience and generosity with myself. Somehow, compassionate pen pals. I want to hold her hand, but when I go to grab it, I see that it’s occupied. She’s trying her hardest to hold it herself. She always will.”</p>***

I’m happy to say that I am leaving this year with notes crammed into the margins. I experienced loss and heartbreak as any girl should, but I looked it all in the face, and I wrote about what I saw. All while the Earth rotated once more.
