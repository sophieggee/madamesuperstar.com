I can’t pin down the exact moment I decided I wanted to move to Manhattan, but I believe it was somewhere between first hearing Cat Power’s rendition of a song by the same name, and walking through Washington Square Park at night in 2015. 

Throughout high school, my mom and I made our way to the city every couple of years. This particular time, we met up with my sister who was living there for the summer. The three of us spent the whole day together and in the afternoon, it was decided that my mom and I would drop Anna off for a date at the park before taking ourselves out for lobster around the block.

I can still hear Washington Square’s nighttime chorus of fountain water, strings, and a solo trumpet player with an open case at his feet. Near the arch, there was an art installation of anonymous letters written by hundreds of obliging citizens. I read each one more enthralled than the last, and became embarrassed when I realized Anna’s date was reading over my shoulder as well. 

The stories had very little prompt or structure. And the loose framework bred heartbreaking tales of love and loss, short, poignant descriptions of daily life, and confessions that stuck with me for the three blocks it took us to walk to the restaurant.

During dinner, my mom and I listened to the ramblings of locals and watched the bartenders interact with regular diners with familial compassion. We sat for what felt like hours, crafting an imaginary life on the relatively quiet side streets of the west village. 

I remember my mom describing the library she would have.

We dipped in and out of reality, assuming we could uproot our suburban family and establish ourselves in the city, but acknowledging we would have to cut back on certain expenses. Eli and I may even have to share a room for his final year of high school (private of course).

My excitement was palpable, and New York must have been listening to my teeming 14-year-old heart, because ever since then, returning has felt like visiting an old friend. I have never felt as close to humanity as when I fall asleep to the unending sounds of traffic flow and crosswalk lights counting down.

The uptown elementary schools hold PE in Central Park. 

When I graduated in April, I didn’t even consider other cities. Parents of my friends and peers in my program often ask me, “Why New York?”, “Do you have family out there?”, “Aren’t you scared?”. My favorite question comes from Utah County parents who inquire, “What will you do there for fun?”. I usually respond with a palatable, “I’m very excited for the museums and maybe I’ll go to shows when I can”. But you can only stroll the floors of the Met so many times a year, and in my 10 or so visits to the city, I’ve never once seen a Broadway show.

The truth is, when I move, I’ll probably do the same things I do anywhere I’ve ever lived. I’ll tickle the back of my roommates, and hold the hand of my boyfriend, and eat food that renders me speechless, and read books under trees. I’ll find trinkets for free on the street or in the booths at flea markets, and take them home with the same energy as a small child that’s just adopted a kitten from a shelter. I’ll make friends with the workers in stores and coffee shops that I deem worthy of my regularity. 

It’s just that now, when I tickle the back of my roommate, my room will be half it’s regular size, and we may have to raise our voices to hear each other over an occasional siren. When I hold the hand of my boyfriend, I may have to use the other to point out a building’s architecture, or a proposal that’s happening. The trees will be in parks that are much more intentionally preserved, and they will have grown with the pride that comes with scarcity. 

When I live in New York City, I’ll do what I always do, and it will be in my favorite place I’ve ever been, and that will just have to do.
