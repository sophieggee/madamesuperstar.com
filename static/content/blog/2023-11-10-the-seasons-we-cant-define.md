As if I needed more outlets to describe myself to the world, I also have a [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7l1msjk1O0drWAgbRt9iaT?si=9b5712a613d545d0). My former roommate Camille and I started this creative endeavor after knowing each other for ~3 months. I think that is tender. We were Sophomores in college and hoping to broadcast our niche corner of counter-counter-culture in Provo to any listening ears (around 150 of our closest friends and family members).

Throughout the past 3 years, we have published 14 episodes. For an average of once a quarter. Every now and then, we feel reinvigorated by the impending financial and otherwise requirements of adult life, which brings us back to the built-in iPhone mics. Writing this out so candidly, I'm realizing how precious I find this process.

Of course these 14 episodes have never brought us a cent in any sort of monetary revenue. Realistically, our quarterly strokes of ambition won't get us very far either.

I'm reminded of a drawing that my first college best friend, Haley McBride drew for me for my birthday card this past year. Both graduating that spring, she thought it appropriate to remind me of our Freshman year together. She drew us side by side outside of our dorm building and wrote "Beautiful Hopeful Brave Girls!!".

The past three podcast episodes Camille and I have published have been unknowingly labeled as "Season 2, Episode 1". A technical representation of the constant hope in ourselves and the capabilities we hypothetically possess to forge a new beginning.

Life's like that.

It would be a tall task to recount the numerous times I have roped more than a few people in my life into a "Rebranding", "Renaissance", "Rising from the Ashes", "Total Transformation". I think "Today is the first day of the rest of my life." could aptly reside on my tombstone.

I have declared new beginning after new beginning, each time saying a dramatic farewell to my past self. Making certain that everyone in my vicinity tunes in for the opening scene of "Season 2".

Of course, in reality, saying farewell to my past self is not only impossible, but undesirable entirely. Season 1 was a hit with the critics, and there are plenty of recurring storylines that deserve to live on.

Most of the time, when I reflect on the various dramatic commencements of my rebirths, I feel disappointed that they might not have panned out in the way I had hoped. I see this cycle as a discouraging and hopefully not inevitable factor of my existence.

But tonight, scrolling through the three first episodes of season 2, I am able to see all the bits and bobs of season 2 sprinkled in places that weren't even labeled as such. I guess instead of failed attempts, I'm starting to see that throughout these declared new beginnings, newness was being lived through day after day.

I'm not sure I have enough energy, triumph, or zest to claim an embarking on a new vision anytime soon. But just this past weekend, I took multiple moments to breathe in New York City. Finally, the city resembles pieces of my long-held dreams.

I started ballet classes with Anna on Saturday. Standing at the barre, looking out at the west side apartments through the studio's large windows, I felt a rush of intense nostalgia. When we pli√©d, I was able to close my eyes and feel my 13-year-old body bend.

All of this: a silent storm of a new season, a beautiful pilot, an unannounced transformation.

The reality is, I won't know what season started when until the aforementioned tombstone comes to fruition. I can't yet tell you when I finished learning what or where and how my grieving manifests itself.

Even using my Freshman year as an example, I can tell you I was most certainly brave and definitely hopeful, but other than that, I can't break that year up into partitions of change and growth. I have no idea what parts of myself I learned about or developed then will continue to show up throughout my years. I can't even tell you if all my bravery was worth it, and I'm even more afraid to address where my hope landed.

For now, I can name any day any episode I would like. I can pronounce a fresh start at any point. None of it changes whose life it is, nor when it has to be lived.

The morning comes even when we're not yet done. This life is mine even when existing feels more like imposing.

The season has surely begun, I bet we're episodes deep. I bet it's beautiful even still.
