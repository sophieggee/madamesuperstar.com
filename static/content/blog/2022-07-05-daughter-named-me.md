## Something I Read in a Book

**"I treat myself like I would my daughter. I brush her hair, wash her laundry, tuck her in goodnight. Most importantly, I feed her. I do not punish her. I do not berate her, leave tears staining her face. I do not leave her alone. I know she deserves more. I know I deserve more."**


I've always loved this sentiment. Of course, I believe there are many takeaways here - one being the undertone of encouraging intuitive eating, discouraging diet culture and negative self talk - but I have been able to enjoy further applications of this analogy in my own life.

For example, sometimes I really do not want to get out of a comfortable position to wash my face or make sure I am in suitable pajamas before I fall asleep. But in those moments of drag and dread, I nearly always stop myself to envision a future child of mine and the ways in which I would feel both obliged and **excited** to tend to her. 

Thinking in this way fills my short walk to the bathroom with a newfound whimsy that carries an irrefutable task. Suddenly, I am being **taken care of** and **I know why**.

Aside from willing myself to do things I may have otherwise put off, I also find myself indulging in healthy pleasures. I let myself dance through public spaces, I allow my bare feet to touch the freshly mowed grass of summertime (while making a point to wash those same feet before tucking myself into a morning-made bed), I stop at the nondescript antique store in a town I've never heard of simply because the window display made me audibly gasp. 

I do these things for myself because it is so easy for me to imagine doing them for a precious child of mine.

A characteristic memory from my childhood is one in which my mom and I were on a walk with my non-verbal brother. We were about to cross the road when I insisted upon my mom holding my hand. She told me that she couldn't hold my hand because she was holding Sam in her arms after he got too tired to walk. Indignantly, I turned towards the street and proclaimed: "Fine. I'll hold my **own** hand".

I think of this statement almost every day. My mom did such a beautiful and loving job of raising me, and even now, several states away and years past legally binding guardianship, I still have crucial pieces of her that I am able to hold onto and access. 

But, in the dim light of my college bedroom after hours of studying and with a stomach half-full of irregular meals, I remind myself of the quote from the book, and I change myself into pink feather-trimmed pajamas, **holding my own hand**.
