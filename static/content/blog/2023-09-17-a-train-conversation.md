A couple of weeks ago I was on the train eavesdropping on two teenage girls (less creepy than it sounds hopefully). They were talking about all of the fun memories they had made over the course of the summer, how much they will miss each other when they go back “home”, and reminiscing on all the touristy things they were able to accomplish in the past few months. As hard as I tried without being too obvious, I could not make out what they had been here for. Was it a summer camp? Had they completed an internship where they lived in intern housing? If it was a camp, was it for dance? Or music? Were they aspiring actors? Did they have counselors?

When I got to my station I felt eager to tell my boyfriend about the conversation I had overheard so we could speculate together. But the walk from the subway to his apartment is two full avenues that contain lots of strangers and shops that capture my attention as well, so by the time I got to him I was having a hard time recalling exactly what I had heard.

I told him “I know they were talking about something I really like” as I was trying to remember what was said. Once I pieced together the bits of their conversation I had overheard, Grant made fun of me for unknowingly prefacing the idea that these two girls may have gone to a summer camp as “something I really like”. 

I laughed as he pointed this out, but the more I thought about it the more I stood by my statement. I *do* really like the idea of those girls having traveled from separate states, preferably nothing like this one, and coming of age during a sort of performing arts camp that I created in my imagination. I also like the idea that they might have made friends with camp counselors or had crushes or broken hearts and rules. I guess when God made me She went a little heavy in staffing the department of whatever it is that summer-camp-subway-girl-fantasy falls under.

I believe it’s this same department that makes me want to take a series of adult ballet classes with my sister and more particularly, my strong desire to have a big recital at the end where we display our new talents and my boyfriend records us on stage. The secretary of this department is any big dog in a halloween costume, and the supply room only offers free stickers from unexpected chain stores and doctors’ offices as tape. 

I can’t pin down exactly what it is about these scenarios or small surprises that make me so fascinated. I don’t know if I should even keep trying to find out, either. I think that my time would be better spent giving a testimony of the importance of feeding this fascination.

I would bet everyone can think of a couple of niche things that make them more excited than originally intended. Maybe it’s a race that someone has put on just for children to run in, or a free belly dancing class at the gym. I know my local library offers a knitting club on Tuesdays, and you can find a bubble machine in almost every corner of Central Park. These things are silly and sweet and sometimes our internal department of order and productivity fights to claim they’re unnecessary.

Don’t get me wrong, I love a productive day cruising through my to-do list as much as anyone, but I can’t remember the last time unloading my groceries made me catch my breath or feel apologetic about how giggly I had become. But when I smile at a doorman fist bumping a first grader after school, or laugh at my reflection in the mirror of my Zumba class as I “make a sassy face”, I remember I’m alive.
