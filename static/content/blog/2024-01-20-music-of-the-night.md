My parents had too many kids at too old of an age to have the energy to film anything I did as a toddler. But I have been told enough times, from enough sources, with enough exactness, to feel confident in stating that I was a fanatic about the Phantom of the Opera (2004) by age three. I don’t remember my very first viewing, (because I think I was belting out the tunes from the comfort of a carseat) but I do remember watching it repeatedly even as I grew older. 

Something about the initial scenes of black and white, the dusty opera hall, Christine’s shaking birdlike notes in her dressing room, the cave’s candlement. I mean to this day I maintain that this film is a flawless production. I believe I’ve watched it from every bed I’ve owned, on any laptop I could get my hands on.

There really is so much to be said about this movie but for the moment, I am pointing to it as the catalyst of my 20-year-long love affair with music. 

Its soundtrack showed me that it’s possible to contract goosebumps from a melody. At an age where honing my EQ wasn’t necessarily a top priority, I was able to empathize deeply and immediately with the emotions in the pieces and I think it really surprised me.

For my next flirtation with the world of music, I have my dad to thank. For as long as I can remember, any free time my dad had (limited) was set to a soundtrack of any one of his thousands of CDs spinning in a stereo. If he was catering to his adolescent and adoring fans, he would put on one or more of the following tracks:

***<p style="text-align: center;">The Babysitter’s Here - Dar Williams</p>***
***<p style="text-align: center;">Daddy’s Little Pumpkin - John Prine</p>***
***<p style="text-align: center;">Gracie - Ben Folds</p>***
***<p style="text-align: center;">Eli’s Coming - Three Dog Night</p>***
***<p style="text-align: center;">Don’t Take Your Guns to Town - Johnny cash</p>***
***<p style="text-align: center;">Zombie - Cranberries</p>***
***<p style="text-align: center;">Daughter - Loudon Wainwright</p>***
***<p style="text-align: center;">Far From Me - John Prine</p>***

As soon as I was old enough to save up enough money for my own personal Purple Emerson CD Player Cassette Boombox Radio FM Stereo, my dad began burning me personalized CDs. He made one for every road trip we took (being sure to order each state-specific song according to the chronological order in which we would pass through it), every birthday (there are a surprising amount of numerically themed songs worth listening to before you have to scrape the bottom of the barrel), and every major life event (most notably: the passing of our beloved family pet, Pedro). 

Another one I remember had songs burned on in order of colors in the rainbow, creating a seamless crescendo into the finale of Blackbird - The Beatles.

Unsurprisingly, this conditioning worked on all four of his children. My very first CD was Lenka’s debut album. The next was Taylor Swift’s. By age eight, I was gifted a Green iPod Shuffle which - for one whole week before my next installment of an $8 allowance - contained only Estelle’s American Boy. 

Around this same stage of my life, I was frequently chauffeured by a 16/17 year old sister in a White 2002 Lincoln Aviator. The car had one blown-out speaker and three others that held on for dear life, braving one Killers song after the next. I have vivid memories of listening to the entirety of Sawdust from three rows back as the windshield displayed every square inch of our painfully suburban hometown.

When Anna was tasked with babysitting the three younger siblings on date nights, our choice activity was driving to the next town over blasting classical music through rolled down windows as we slowly surveyed the skate park. 

I don’t think I could have dreamt up anything quite as hysterical to that little me. I thought I was the luckiest girl in the greater Seattle area. And I don’t know for certain that I wasn’t.

Another time I sat, mouth open, in complete awe as my cousin fumbled his way through a loose interpretation of Weezer’s Beverly Hills on his hand-me-down electric guitar (complete with dramatic swinging of arms and the jumping on of twin bed).

I couldn’t think of one reason why Beverly Hills wasn’t exactly where I wanted to be as well. 

I conjured up every moment of betrayal from the hallways of my elementary school and any memory of my mom declining to drive me to a friend’s house and decided that I, alongside Rivers Cuomo, “(did)n't stand a chance. It's something that you're born into, and I just (did)n’t belong.”

The following year, my parents took us to New York City for the first time. We were all able to watch the Christmas Spectacular with the Rockettes and I sat with my eyes glued to the stage all night. Upon returning to the hotel, family lore states that I declared without question that I too would become a Rockette. I said it as casually as letting the room know what I would wear the next day (something I would probably also do - both in 2009 and today).

Music of all kinds found its way into my heart and body while in my most nascent form. It’s as if someone pressed play in the delivery room and the sound inside me hasn’t paused since. 


Of course music has existed long before I was even a figment of anyone’s imagination, and it will continue to be created and listened to long after I fade out of every living memory.

But while I’m here, a beautiful portion of these everlasting instrumentals and stanzas and bridges make up my biological scrapbook. 

There’s a page where I am Christine Daaé for my first solo trick-or-treat. 

An interactive, collapsable list of all the many reasons why my dad had to play “just one more” Beatles song so I could fully understand the depths of their nuanced feuds.

There are darker corners where Bright Eyes and Elliott Smith lyrics are dramatically scrawled in repetition on middle school bathroom stall walls. 

I hope there’s even a sketch of me dancing on a table for the very first time at Anna’s 17th birthday party to the undeniable beat of I Gotta Feeling - Black Eyed Peas.

What I listen to day to day changes with each passing year, just ask my Odesza-littered 2015 Spotify playlists. But part of what’s powerful about these songs is that each tie to them makes its mark in your psyche.

Mazzy Star’s Fade Into You will always be the “Our Song” of my first relationship.

I can’t imagine I will ever shake the fact that Glass Animals single-handedly healed wounds between myself and my middle-to-high-school best friend.

The explosive chorus of Night Shift - Lucy Dacus will always play out in my head as a low budget duet involving both the original artist and my very passionate roommate who was wronged once.

I hope I never listen to Hey Jude without feeling how fast my mom’s car can drive with my friend in the passenger seat next to me.

Unfortunately I don’t know if I’ll be able to get all the way through Vienna - Billy Joel without remembering my dad once dismissed it as “tacky”.

And whenever I hear the initial chords of Somebody Told Me - The Killers, a part of me will always be sitting in that Aviator, three rows back, in permanent awe.
