A week ago, March 19, was the first day of spring this year. 

Spring has been my favorite season ever since I was still writing my “r”s backward when responding to preschool prompts. Then, and probably a good deal now as well, it was because my birthday is April 6, always 2-3 weeks into the beginning of this transformative season. Just long enough to see hints of new growth and spurts of above-60-degree weather but not deep enough into the season to retire your puffer.

I would like to think spring is my favorite season today for more reasons than that it houses my birthday, but I bet it would be just fine if that was the sole reason.

One of my favorite authors, Jenny Slate, also has a spring birthday (March 25). Which is significant because she writes one of my favorite chapters, “I Was Born: About to Bust” in one of my favorite books, “Little Weirds” all about when she was born.

“I was born on the boundary line between cold and hot, at the intersection of the two elements that make a clap of thunder. (...) I was born when living things remember to wake up again. I was born just when you think that birth won’t happen, because it has been cold for so long. (...) 

“In the very grooves of my being is the desire to bust open, and **the certainty that it is right to begin to live again even after long periods of cold and darkness.** (...)

“I was born and everything in nature seemed like arms reaching out. I was born and the wildness from outside put itself inside of me.”

God gave me “Little Weirds”. And by that I mean that God put Eleanor Larson in my life (that isn’t a belief so much as it is fact) and then reminded her to present me the book for my 20th birthday three years ago.

Since then, I have read and re-read the book a number of times, all falling at transitional periods of my life. After a breakup, after a move, after another move, after another breakup, and then again this past week. 

What prompted my read-through this most recent time was different from the others in that there hasn’t been some tangible shift in life circumstances that occurred over the past month. However, parts of its catalyst felt familiar as I found myself feeling unappreciated, completely misunderstood, angry with myself and others, and wholly out of place.

I don’t want to convey a more dramatic message than necessary. I’m doing perfectly fine, in fact better than I have been in over two years I might even say (wow I genuinely didn’t know that about myself until just now but it’s true!!!). 

I guess you’ll just have to take my word for it: that I can have this full-body conviction of displacement amid the beginnings of true, settled contentment.

Regardless of my overarching emotional temperature, there are still days that leave me feeling so deeply defeated. I lie in bed lecturing to myself that everything I might have hoped for in one specific aspect of my life is totally out of reach and what’s worse is that there’s no one to blame (I try and fail to avoid using myself as a temporary stand-in until I really get to the bottom of who’s at fault – I’m the World’s Most Useless Detective). 

And so because after all that investigation I feel under complete attack, I go to bed holding myself and I wake up trying to remember all of the things I have done On Purpose. I recite my life choices like affirmations to remember I am sane.

Now that I’ve explained some of what plagues me you might hopefully be able to understand how natural it is for me to every once in a while need some good old fashioned comfort. 

Last week I turned to a trusted group chat with the earnest ask: “Does anyone have any book recs for this: light, will take my mind off things, not hard to read but pleasantly thought-provoking, think: ‘Little Weirds’”. And after sincere brainstorming, we collectively concluded that, “Literally nothing is like ‘Little Weirds’” and so I returned to the sacred script.

I promise this piece is still about the spring but I can’t go further without acknowledging that these two things – the beginning of spring and my reading of “Little Weirds” – feel so tied together in my mind right now that to try and distinguish the exact topic of this post and decide which thoughts caused the others feels useless and minimizing.

On a morning when I felt especially wrong for my Big Emotions, and rather hopeless about the future of some of my most critical relationships, I started my commute and I read this line in the book, “Look! Look at this woman who is both the emergency and the relief. Let me be both (I have no choice). Give in. Fall apart. Look at the pieces. Reassemble. This is the essential movement of my holy flux.”

And then I am crying in Times Square.

There is nothing like looking down at the page of a book only to find a reflection of your innermost self looking back up at you. How did you find that! I thought I hid her away!

And next I read, “As the image of myself becomes sharper in my brain and more precious, I feel less afraid that someone else will erase me by denying me love.”

And then I find new hope in the elevator to my office. I have been given an inspiring and refreshing affirmation.

With all that, comes me.

With all that, comes Spring.

Every year around this same time, I shed parts of my old self without even realizing. I part ways with things that don’t ring true any longer, the clothes fly off of my body and into the hands of Buffalo Exchange in droves. The whole city stops to watch the big scene. Blue Angels of the springtime!

This year’s spring feels like a total reclaiming of the self I have always been. With every new bloom, I feel pangs of resounding familiarity. 

I walk through the streets and I see that some of the blossoms are pink already. I remember a story from when I was little about rehearsing numbers for my family and whispering “Superstar” at every finale.

I see that they are repainting the road signs near my house just in time for the new weather. I used to pray to God every night and remind Him that I had one sister and two brothers.

I saw someone cutting a branch of the cherry blossom tree and taking it inside for decoration. I used to want to “hunt” but really what I was asking for was the ability to capture small bears and take them home to raise as my own.

It’s cyclical! Can you see that or is it just me?

I am so grateful for the springtime because every year, just when I have forgotten that it can still happen, I am given the opportunity to remember myself.

It’s like the moment in Cinderella when she can finally leave for the ball but she gets so discouraged that she has nothing to wear anyway. 

Spring is my fairy godmother that says, “No no! Remember, you can watch as nature adorns herself and settles back into her favorite state and you can do the exact same thing. The cold before this was a necessary part of you too, but you have taken what you needed and now you can dance!”

Just as winter and spring both necessarily exist, I contain both the emergency and the relief. 

That’s always been true. 

My mom says I was the 4-year-old winner of the Most Meltdowns in Malls and simultaneously her most affectionate child.

Sometimes it’s so overwhelming to remember all the meltdowns, disappointments, times my emotions riddle others with distrust, or listen to the screaming voice inside my head reminding me of the sheer volume of space I always seem to take up.

I’m sure parts of these things are always true, I have weak spots and selfish desires and I will probably always have to consciously (and sometimes fail at) balance drawing the right amount of attention to myself.

It’s hard to remember but I really believe I am glad those versions of me exist. 

I don’t love walking home physically exerting effort to push against the violent winds at 30 degrees, but when I am encouraged to take the whole day off because of the fact of a 70 degree forecast, I am so grateful to be as excited as I am.

Without all these insecurities and blindspots, I can hardly imagine finding or wanting to find a “whole new me”. Pinterest would surely lose a portion of its internet traffic from the greater New York area if I thought I had everything ironed out.

I’m starting to genuinely believe that with every layer I shed, the image of myself becomes sharper in my brain.

It takes all of winter for me to understand the value of and fully identify with the purpose of spring. But I’m so glad that’s the case.

I love it where I am.
