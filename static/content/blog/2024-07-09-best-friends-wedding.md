I just recently (July 2nd) had the pleasure of officiating the Sweet New Union of two of my favorite people. I have written the speech up here, along with some director's cut footage.

For example:

See?

Welcome everyone, I am so honored and excited to be here with you all. This day is surreal and beautiful and I’m sure I don’t have to convince any of you of that.

When Hans and Elena reached out to ask me to perform this ceremony they had two requests. One being that I look fabulous, and two being that I paint a picture of their story. I’ll let you all be the judge of both.

Thoughts?

I seemed like an appropriate person for this job given that I initially set them up on a blind date in the fall of 2020.

I never could have imagined blindly texting Elena, and I quote, “Elena it is Sophie Gee are you or are you not dating someone right now” would lead us all here. Rather bold for a first text to someone I had only met twice before, but today I am grateful for that gall.

I know that nothing I could say up here in the next 10 minutes could do justice to their steady, confident, and ever-growing love story. But I am a woman of my word, so I’ll try.

As I said, I originally thought of this pairing almost four years ago. Our group chat is aptly entitled, “My Greatest Thought Experiment Yet” so I believe it’s only appropriate that I use this time to explain why.

I met Elena first. It’s kind of hard to describe what it’s like to meet someone like her. Mostly because I can’t think of anyone that fits the bill. Getting to know and understand Elena is completely unique. A visual that comes to mind is finding a breathtaking and serene hot spring in an otherwise intimidating forest. Which is fitting, since I met Elena my freshman year at a Provo house party, which is about as close to a dark forest as a social event can get.

That night, I think it took all of ten minutes before we were sitting on the carpeted floor of a side room holding both hands as we experienced the catharsis of social exhaustion. She’s the most determined listener I have ever met.

All she had to know was my name before it became her full-time job to soak up every ounce of my makeup and emotions.

Alongside her sincere and humble absorption, I remember her as particularly starry-eyed and delicate. She felt more sure of others’ convictions than she ever allowed herself to feel of her own.

Every social event has a shining star. The kind of person you meet and have little hesitation about wanting to see them again. An unexpected enthralling conversation, or the perfect ratio of listening ear to witty jokes. Elena was undoubtedly mine that night.

I didn’t deserve her then and I don’t deserve her now. She will always be every room’s “shining star”.

Around this same time, I became quick and close friends with Hans. He was my first male friend at Uni. And with great power comes great responsibility.

I remember spending hours in the car with Hans debriefing that night’s group hang out or driving to and from the library to spend our days studying.

We would discuss music and politics and love and fear and I will always be grateful for the example Hans set in my adult life of a genuinely interested and caring friend.

It didn’t even take one full hour of these conversations to recognize real thought within Hans. He is intelligent and witty and interesting and at the end of most nights he was brimming with observations on unspoken interactions in a group setting.

Hans approaches everything in his life with a level of reverence and forethought I find admirable. Kind of reminds me of the way I would want a friend to experience being introduced to that quiet hot spring in the complicated forest.

Given how precious Elena had already become to me, I knew that if I were to introduce her to anyone, let alone a potential romantic interest, he would have to be thoughtful, patient, appreciative, and warm.

One night on 500 north, Hans and I walked past a mailbox tagged with a sticky note instructing pedestrians to, “Stay Safe! Don’t be dumb!” - Mom. This sticky note was a product of a street art passion project performed by Elena. A testament to her gentle, creative, and humble love.

![Stay Safe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/master/static/content/image/elena_and_hans/stay_safe.jpg "Stay Safe")

Hans remarked on being endeared by this public instruction and I remembered that I had seen Elena post about this project online. Thus, the thought child was born.

We didn’t even get to the end of the block before I texted Elena my famous inquiry and very confidently showed Hans a picture of his future wife.

(I showed him this picture)

(I showed her this one)

Their first date was at a park with an assorted display of Trader Joe’s snacks that they independently cleared with me beforehand. I totally get it, chocolate-dipped pretzels and strawberries can be a big risk. That’s just not a decision you make alone.

(I wished them luck)

Needless to say, I was thrilled to hear from both of them independently for a full debrief afterwards.

(she borrowed my earrings)

Something noteworthy is that Hans had been wary of the date being towards the end of that day because of all the tasks and social interactions that preceded it. I don’t know if you guys know that Hans can be a bit introverted, but it’s important to this story that we know he normally recharges alone. He said normally dates have high stakes and aren’t the greatest remedy for a socially drained battery, but being with Elena felt different. He felt ensconced and present in their conversation and left the picnic with more energy than he had beforehand.

The response I received from Elena is similarly cataloged. Her texts read as follows: “my heart is just”, “cat heart eye emoji, smiling with hearts surrounding emoji, pouty face emoji, content emoji, sunglass emoji,” and 13 others with similar sentiments.

So yeah, I guess we could call that a smashing success.

The beginning of their courtship had its share of uncertainties on both ends.

The same insecurities and overthinking that got in the way of their own lives seeped into the constitution of their early relationship as well.

But I never could have known what I did that night on 500 N.

Slowly but steadily, each made the other more confident. Their individual propensities for loyalty and unconditional, thought-filled support built up the foundation of the other and in doing so, the relationship.

Over the past three and a half years, I have watched in awe as the two grew together from separate, slightly scared, and at times ceaselessly anxious lovers to the quietly confident, assured and established body of love and support that stand together today.

I spent a lot of 2021 with Elena listening to her grapple with the overwhelming permanency of marriage and the decisions that precede long distance relationships.

She felt that familiar feeling of being slightly unsure of herself and too young to make any big decisions, especially one that would greatly affect the life of someone she loved as much as Hans.

But by the time summer of 2022 rolled into view, Elena was able to land herself an impressive internship in a daunting New York City while Hans studied in an econ program at Cambridge. Long distance was not a question but a solution.

Both her and Hans talked of their weekends and days together that summer as rare miracles with all of their favorite activities. My phone calls with Elena were not filled with anguish or impatience as long distance can often bring, so much as excitement and anticipation for the next Hans sighting.

They weren’t calling me with questions anymore. They were calling with answers.

That fall brought the two closer together as Elena got a job that would continue to host her in the states and even bought her very own car.

All advancements that I can only imagine would make the 19 year old Elena at that house party cover her mouth in shock. Let alone what would happen when we tell her about the total hunk she scored.

That last year and provo was filled with sweet traditions like Sunday Scrabble at Starbucks and plenty of time with friends. Many of us watched as the two spent time with both of their families and gushed over pictures of pippi the dog and baby mila. Elena excitedly reported on helping Kirsten paint her new office pink.

Their love was becoming familiar and their lives enmeshed. The hesitations or uncertainties slipped away with each passing month. Every answer started to seem so clear.

By the winter of 2023, Hans had gotten into the very competitive LSE. His dream school, located in the home of his soon-to-be-deported dream girl.

I still remember where I was when Elena told me that Hans got into LSE. But more importantly to this story, I remember how he told her he got in.

He had left her a sticky note saying “Elena, I love you! The future is scary but I’m really glad I get to face it with you! You make me feel like I can face and handle anything!” complete with the postscript proclamation, “I got into LSE!”. 

![Sticky Note](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/master/static/content/image/elena_and_hans/stick_note.jpg "Sticky Note")
![LSE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sophieggee/madamesuperstar.com/master/static/content/image/elena_and_hans/I_got_into_LSE.jpg "LSE")

Hans had not found out he got in, ruminated in the anxiety of the doors this would open and the decisions it would require, and then approached Elena with his stream of consciousness.

Instead, having just found out he accomplished a nearly lifelong goal, Hans believed the most important thing to communicate was his love and appreciation for Elena, only followed by the victorious statement. No questions.

In the confident security and mutual support of their love, the two celebrated one another’s bold accomplishments and decisions, surrendering completely to a beautiful future together.

Throughout this past year in London, my calls with Elena have informed me of several romantic and eventful weekends spent in the city, as well as the quaint Wednesday tradition of breakfast before work.

I wasn’t surprised at all to hear about this sacred ritual. To me, it’s a perfectly apt byproduct of their relationship. It’s reliable like a weekday, filled with possibilities like the morning, and repeated.

Gone are the days I would have to be consulted by either party for the least embarrassing pastry to order.

In a way, it’s ironic that I am standing up here with you two, because I have never been less involved in this love.

Over time, when someone shows up for you enough, and is able to help convince you of your worth to the extent that it’s always within you, requests for external reassurance become obsolete.

Hans has found in Elena someone who can continually put his racing mind at ease. She’s the calm that follows the storm. She always has been. She’s there for him when an opinion is necessary, but mostly she’s a fervent supporter, and the most dedicated cheerleader I’ve ever met.

Within Hans, Elena has found someone who can remind her every single day of the consistent love and refreshing perspective she brings the world, and she is no longer left wondering if her voice is worthy of amplification.

Together, they are gentle, assured, uplifting, a very reliable group facetime call, and completely in love.

I think I speak for all of us in saying it is an inspiring togetherness to watch, and I am honored to have played any part in it.

But today, you two together are entirely an entity of your own hard work, determination, and unending selfless love and compassion. And that is worthy of great celebration.

Now, I have some very pressing questions for you two.

Do you, Elena Andria Deighton, vow to share your life openly with Hans Peter Nilsson, to speak the truth to him in love, to honor and tenderly care for him, to cherish and encourage him through all the changes of your lives?

Do you, Hans Peter Nilsson, vow to share your life openly with Elena Andria Deighton, to speak the truth to her in love, to honor and tenderly care for her, to cherish and encourage her through all the changes of your lives?

Now we come to the exchange of rings, a symbol of the promises you have made to each other.

Hans, please take Elena’s hand. Place the ring on her finger and repeat after me:

I give you this ring,
A symbol of my love
As I give you all that I am.
And I accept all that you are.

Elena, please take Hans’s hand. Place the ring on his finger and repeat after me:

I give you this ring,
A symbol of my love
As I give you all that I am.
And I accept all that you are.

With the love you have declared and the vows you have made, it is with great joy that I now pronounce you husband and wife. Hans and Elena, you may share your first kiss as a married couple!

I love these two crazy kids, here is the three of us having our last night of freedom before the shackles of matrimony descend upon us all. (Joke of course, did you not just read how in love they are???)
