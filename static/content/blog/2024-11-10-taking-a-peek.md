Basically what happened is that in the past week one of my best friends from my college came to stay with me in my apartment in New York. And while that was happening, I was also   planning a trip that was supposed to start this week to San Francisco to visit some other of my best friends. And then what really gave me this epiphany was that I was on a phone call with another friend and she was discussing a recent trip she had gone on to visit a friend that no longer lives a drivable distance away from her.

My conversation on the phone was mainly to try and help to validate my friend in feeling like there was something “off” about the recent trip she took to visit someone she loves. She couldn’t make sense of it because she always had so much fun with them in college together, and now visiting them in a new environment where she was staying in their new house and sleeping on their new couch just felt all wrong. Their dynamics had shifted, and more was at play than ever before. 

What I tried to tell her is that I know these feelings all too well. Ever since leaving high school and the state where I lived for so long and made so many close friends, I have had to approach the task of visiting the people I love in entirely new places. Graduating from college and moving across the country has only burdened this task. 

When you move away from a place you’ve established yourself in, instead of casual and unplanned even lazy-in-a-good-way times with friends who are also your neighbors, you have to enter into a whole new contract. The new contract is about the amount of time spent on the phone, and who likes texting and who doesn’t, who has social media and has been keeping up that way, and who doesn’t but you still need them to know. Who lives where and how much would you want to visit that place? 

And in so many ways your friendship is all of the sudden being weighed and scored and examined, one culprit being the question of: “Would I go to this same place on a trip if this person I love didn’t live there?” and then you’re sometimes even upset and wondering about that because it’s like “Wake up!! I would go anywhere for you!!”

If your friend lives in a place that you may not have normally gotten to by this point in your life, then the pressure is on. The friend is now a Host. When have they ever had to be The Host before? Plenty of my friends hate being a Host and they don’t even have their own birthday parties because that’s not how they like to spend the day they get to do anything with. I think it’s impressive that they know that about themselves and yet it’s sometimes logistically impossible to avoid crowning them with this title. The alternative is potentially going a full year (or more) without seeing them, which I hate.

Another case to consider is that your friend lives in a place you have always wanted to go, and then it’s a “great excuse to visit (London) anyway”. But then there’s a delicate balance of seeing the sights that they’ve already seen plenty of while making sure they know that you would visit them in Nebraska too, if that’s where their heart lived.

And when there’s a lot to do in Your Place then you have to create excel spreadsheets of recommendations for guests to evaluate and forge a visit-path, and when there’s nothing to do in Your Place then you have to apologize that things –or worse: your life/you – are “so boring”.

Not to mention the lack of alone time or decompression when back-to-back sleepovers are necessary and you don’t have a car or agenda of your own.

I’ve never felt anything else like it; it’s completely dizzying. 

All of this information seemed to help my friend on the phone to remember to give herself and the relationship with her host some grace. This is all new to them and to us. It’s not something we actively agree upon when entering a friendship and yet it’s something we desperately desire to make work.

After outlining just a few of the several anxieties that this chapter of friendship introduces, I want to direct your attention to its beauty. There is a desperate desire to make something unideal and new work that is fed by your love for and trust of your good friend.

One of the sweetest sentiments I have felt/ heard of when visiting a friend in their new home is the idea that now you have obtained visuals for the events they relay to you over the phone. 

I have visited a few friends at the University of Washington and I have made them show me their library, the walk to class, their home, any prominent friend’s home, etc. I want to create mind illustrations based in reality. I want to know what it feels like to walk on the quad where they saw their crush on the way to class. 

It’s a whole new opportunity, which is very exciting.

Another key component of all of this is that often (hopefully), friends are choosing for themselves where to live and what to do and who to be with. After the time you had together where you were in similar circumstances, they chose something new and maybe more true to them. And maybe you did too.

My best friend Haley lives on a river in Idaho for almost six months out of every year. We met in the dorms of the college we attended that we probably wouldn’t choose to attend today. I feel like I can never get enough of her descriptions of her life and the scenery. She’s happier than I have ever known her to be, and I plan to visit her in Her Place this summer. Sleeping on a river is outside of my comfort zone, but the prospect of doing something so fully within hers feels safe enough to me, and I hope it happens.

This summer, I had the distinct opportunity of visiting my good friends Elena and Hans in their new flat in Clapham, London. They had just moved in together because they were getting married. I loved hearing about the (albeit stressful) house hunting preceding my trip and I was very excited at the idea of getting to see where they will spend part of a future together. Walking from the tube station to their flat I remember thinking, “I really love it here for them, this is exactly where I want them to be” (not that it matters what I want, but it’s still sweet to know). 

We walked past the fresh-smelling bakeries and there was a gift shop that was coincidentally selling the same fish-shaped pitcher I had bought them for their wedding as a surprise. I took that as a great omen. I am so grateful to know and love the world my friends have carved out for themselves.

Eleanor came this week and she was staying in my apartment for three of the seven nights she was in town. I was looking forward to her coming for a month. We call every week and I live for her photos over text and her newest sketches, but I also want to hear what comes to her mind when we haven’t said anything at all in ten minutes and we are finding our way to sleep. 

Her visit came with the same anxieties I get with any houseguest. I wanted her to love New York City for herself and not just for me, I wanted every siren and bad man on the street and rat and smell to take a hike for the week. I wanted impossible things because I love her so much, and this time together in person is rare.

Another thing about my life right now is how precious my roommates are to me. While I can handle someone visiting and not understanding living in this city, “not vibing” with my roommates is frankly, unacceptable. I don’t even care if it’s trite – they are in every way but legal, My Family. 

Having Eleanor here was especially significant because organically and all on her own (because of who she is and who my roommates are), she formed real relationships with all three of my roommates. The five of us spent a good part of a Sunday together holding hands and having breakthroughs in my queen bed. By the end of the week, we stayed up until 1 am on Friday asking each other how we would classify our inner demons (if applicable).

It is so fun when a big part of your social circle is connected by a common entity (i.e. school, where your parents live), but there is an unmatched sense of reassurance that comes with a dear friend choosing to enter through the doorway of your “new life”, taking a peek, asking questions and ooh-ing and ah-ing. 

You get to remember that they love you just for you, and they care about what you do and who you surround yourself with because learning more about you is never too much. They want to know every part.
