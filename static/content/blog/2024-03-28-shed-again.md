Every year around this same time, I shed parts of my old self without even realizing. I part ways with things that don’t ring true any longer, the clothes fly off of my body and into the hands of Buffalo Exchange in droves. The whole city stops to watch the big scene. Blue Angels of the springtime!

This year’s spring feels like a total reclaiming of the self I have always been. With every new bloom, I feel pangs of resounding familiarity. 

I walk through the streets and I see that some of the blossoms are pink already. I remember a story from when I was little about rehearsing numbers for my family and whispering “Superstar” at every finale.

I see that they are repainting the road signs near my house just in time for the new weather. I used to pray to God every night and remind Him that I had one sister and two brothers.

I saw someone cutting a branch of the cherry blossom tree and taking it inside for decoration. I used to want to “hunt” but really what I was asking for was the ability to capture small bears and take them home to raise as my own.

It’s cyclical! Can you see that or is it just me?

I am so grateful for the springtime because every year, just when I have forgotten that it can still happen, I am given the opportunity to remember myself.

It’s like the moment in Cinderella when she can finally leave for the ball but she gets so discouraged that she has nothing to wear anyway. 

Spring is my fairy godmother that says, “No no! Remember, you can watch as nature adorns herself and settles back into her favorite state and you can do the exact same thing. The cold before this was a necessary part of you too, but you have taken what you needed and now you can dance!”

Just as winter and spring both necessarily exist, I contain both the emergency and the relief. 

That’s always been true. 

My mom says I was the 4-year-old winner of the Most Meltdowns in Malls and simultaneously her most affectionate child.

Sometimes it’s so overwhelming to remember all the meltdowns, disappointments, times my emotions riddle others with distrust, or listen to the screaming voice inside my head reminding me of the sheer volume of space I always seem to take up.

I’m sure parts of these things are always true, I have weak spots and selfish desires and I will probably always have to consciously (and sometimes fail at) balance drawing the right amount of attention to myself.

It’s hard to remember but I really believe I am glad those versions of me exist. 

I don’t love walking home physically exerting effort to push against the violent winds at 30 degrees, but when I am encouraged to take the whole day off because of the fact of a 70 degree forecast, I am so grateful to be as excited as I am.

Without all these insecurities and blindspots, I can hardly imagine finding or wanting to find a “whole new me”. Pinterest would surely lose a portion of its internet traffic from the greater New York area if I thought I had everything ironed out.

I’m starting to genuinely believe that with every layer I shed, the image of myself becomes sharper in my brain.

It takes all of winter for me to understand the value of and fully identify with the purpose of spring. But I’m so glad that’s the case.

I love it where I am.
