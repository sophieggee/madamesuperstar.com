I want a stranger to ask “are you not FREEZING?” in a way that makes me feel like if I say “yes, I am” they may offer me a fur coat, or woven blanket. 

I want the people on the corners of the streets that have coordinated shirts and clipboards not to ask me to sign anything in particular, but instead to ask me how I am, and to write down my response with earnest and love. 

I want the person on the sidewalk to come into a lump sum of one million dollars from an anonymous donor named “Magenta” but to keep playing the saxophone as a way to show gratitude and as a form of asking nothing at all. 

I want to show everyone the ocean.

I want to walk past a skyscraper made of stained glass, and actually just laugh out loud.

I want the wind to blow only when it’s decidedly too hot out, as if to say “I know you’re feeling a little flushed, and I love you a lot”

I want the world to know I am in love and I want it to say back “I hope it is with me!” and then I will say “of course it is with you, you silly little green thing!”
