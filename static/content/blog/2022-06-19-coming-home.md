## A Plea Written to My Hometown

I’ve been so many places with so many people since the last time it saw me. How will it recognize me? 

Should I play Grouplove or drive with my feet out the window? Do I need to put on a Brandy Melville sweatshirt or grow my hair out? 

What if I buy and wear 4 too many rings? What about then?
Please please recognize me! I’m going to need it this time!!
