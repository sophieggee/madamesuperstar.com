Deleting social media was not a new concept to me when Macy (my roommate) introduced me to the ideas behind [Ignite](https://www.getignite.org/). Ignite’s challenge is one I have unofficially accepted time and time again, whenever I got brave enough to cut the cord, so to speak.

I have plenty of thoughts on the rewiring I can feel take place in my brain as I remind myself that there is no longer an audience waiting on the other side of my cheeky thought or sun-soaked film photo.

I, too, have gotten caught in the whirlwind of comparison and the rush of showing off. The more validation I receive via DM or passing comment referencing my online presence, the more intoxicating the entrance of that storm.

But in hopes of offering something potentially resonatory about the deeper gut-wrenching effect social media has had on me, and the subsequent relief I feel from this break, I will be writing about my ex. 
 
Per Macy’s enthusiastic referral, I read Oliver Burkeman’s *4000 Weeks* earlier this year. I often think about an immediately striking point he makes concerning social media. He offers the idea that we are in constant search of ‘busyness’. 

Social media is “essentially a giant machine for persuading you to make the wrong choices about what to do with your attention, and therefore with your finite life, by getting you to care about things you didn’t want to care about”.

After my breakup in October, I found myself busying myself with the unending search for futile and often harmful information all the time. Void of my long-term relationship, and left with a wandering mind in its place, I became the world’s most useless archeologist. 

I hesitate (grasping at any dignity I wish to maintain) to list all of the information I found myself indexing, but I’m sure anyone who’s ever been in love or even found infatuation can fill in the gaps. 

From thumbing through old posts of ours to cross-referencing Venmo transactions and Spotify activity with faces on Instagram, I was not where I wanted to be. 

Months removed from the situation, and even at the time, I know there was nothing to be gained from this bottomless well. As Burkeman states, “We cannot get anything out of life. There is no outside where we could take this thing to. There is no little pocket, situated outside of life, to which we could steal life’s provisions and squirrel them away.”

The same can be cited with social media in “life”’s place. I was hoarding this hazardous information to place, where exactly?

I guess the most succinct way I can put the urgent desire for this information is that I was addicted to the idea that at one point I might know everything that could possibly disappoint me. I might reach the end of my blindspots, protecting me from “being the last to know”.

This addiction, like any other, is tied to an artificial end. 

I am never going to be able to protect myself from all forms of disappointment, I will never run out of people to compare myself to, or corners to turn that expose oversights of all kinds. 

The most devastating part of this whole story is that there is a multi-billion dollar industry dedicated to making me believe otherwise.

It is not until we relieve ourselves of the possibility of digging these holes, turning the corners, reaching the beginning of these spirals, let alone the fictional end, that we can feel fulfilled in the information we already contain.

Deleting the source of this temporary satiation was always my only answer. For me, that looks like deleting Instagram for the foreseeable future, cutting off my access to the supply. For you it could look different, and maybe it’s not your ex, maybe it’s a celebrity or an old friend, or any other victim of your brain’s desperate attempts to busy your mind.

But peace will only come from putting those attempts to rest, reminding yourself that there is no way to scratch that itch even if you wanted to. And over time, I find myself wanting to less and less. Without Instagram, there are a lot less ways for me to be reminded of the itch in the first place.

Busyness never was the answer, it’s so obvious yet somehow remains captivating. In a lot of ways, turning off this illusion of productivity brings us closer to that truth every day.
