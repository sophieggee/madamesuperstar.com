	<h1>What is this Wild Place?</h1>

	<p>I'm so happy you're here! Because I have a lot to say.</p>

	<p>
		My name is Sophie Gee, seemingly the sole patron of Instagram to coin the stage name <a
			href="https://www.instagram.com/madame.superstar/">Madame Superstar</a
		>. I wonder what a stage name does for someone with no stage; I guess we're all here to find
		out. The intent of this website is to lure prospective employers in using my resume, and to
		scare them off using my words.

	</p>

	<p>Okay, I am fairly certain that is the end of the rules.</p>

	<p>
		I started this blog during my final summer of college while living at home with my parents, and
		I have returned to it somewhat regularly as both a dazzling stage and a void to scream in. So
		here I am, and here you are, and I just hope you enjoy.
